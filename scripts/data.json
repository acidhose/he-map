    "description": "Floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters on the earth, and the frequency of flood events has rapidly increased worldwide. Various models for quantifying flood discharge have been developed, but they require significant data input, in particular regarding accurate river cross sections and accurate locations. These data are mostly not available or not accurately represented, especially in developing countries. Thus, this project will address the flood model challenge in river cross section data. This study contains a combination of applied and scientific research and is divided into two components. In the applied component, the research team will work to find flood magnitude trends, causes, and vulnerable locations and propose a reasonable solution for this problem in the Kabul River Basin. The second component is focused on the scientific problem of hydrologic models. The research team will work to reflect the influence of the basin’s river network by a coefficient or equation on peak flow and peaking time in the basin outlet. This element of the study involves development of a novel and very simple approach for flood flow computation using lumped hydrologic models. The U.S. partner, Dr. Nelson, will cooperate on the effort and may incorporate it into a model (iRIC) that he is developing with U.S. Geological Survey support.",

First, the research team will work on recovering the gap of observed climate data to create a dataset combining historical climate and hydrologic data from Afghan stations and information from the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit. Second, to translate the meaning of these data to the country’s mountainous regions, where surface data have been sparse even during the best of times, the researchers will compare their reconstructions of surface measurements with remotely sensed data of snow cover and snow water equivalent derived by their U.S. partner covering the period from 2000 to the present. The resulting analyses will provide a base for scientific and engineering modeling on Afghanistan river basins. As there are limited studies on Afghanistan water resources conducted by international organizations, the created dataset will be used in engineering models to examine the current and future status of climatic parameters and water availability in Afghanistan. The study will provide datasets for Afghanistan water-related projects and programs, particularly in transboundary water resource management, and also engineering information regarding the quantity of Afghanistan water resource for use in decision and policy making.",

Extreme droughts are expected to occur more frequently in the coming decades, and this may cause major economic losses and social and environmental disasters. The overall objective of this research is developing, validating, and implementing a drought monitoring system for the Amu Darya and Kabul Basins in Afghanistan. The researchers will work to provide reliable information that can be used towards a drought mitigation, risk management, and planning strategy. Regionalization of this model for the Afghanistan basins would promote better monitoring and prediction of droughts and enhance decision making and risk reduction efforts. \n \n This research will build upon the successful development and implementation of previous UNESCO drought monitoring systems and will enhance risk management and drought mitigation by providing consistent and continuous drought information. The system would provide drought monitoring information based on multiple indicators and data sources, including satellite observations and local ground-based information. Providing multi-model, multi-index, seasonal drought prediction information for Afghanistan is an integral part of the implementation. The use of a single index to indicate the diversity and complexity of drought conditions and impacts is one of the major limitations to drought monitoring. For this reason, the system to be developed and tested by this team will provide drought information based on multiple univariate drought indicators and one multivariate drought index.",

    "description": "This project will address the issues of depleting artesian water resources in the Ararat Valley. An increasing numbers of fish farms in the valley have substantially decreased the level of artesian water in the area. Although profitable in current market conditions, these fish farms operate primarily using inefficient water technologies. The first step in the project will be to analyze targeted fish farms in the Ararat Valley to determine the current production models being used and recommend appropriate best practices for water-efficient aquaculture. The researchers will also study the potential for improving discharge water distribution efficiency and discharge water quality for targeted fish farms to agricultural plots in the Ararat Valley. After analyzing the current regulatory framework, the team will then produce recommendations for improved policy for water usage in fish farm production systems and for better management of discharge water. Throughout the process, they will engage key stakeholders to ensure their input is included in the study and to inform them of recommended policies and actions. The U.S. Government-supported partner will contribute by providing expertise about best international practices of operating fish farms and water usage in fish farms. \n \n The key development impacts of the SFEWRA project lie in ensuring more inclusive and sustainable economic growth by fostering sustainable fisheries that use water more efficiently. The project will also build and strengthen the research capacity of ICARE and the various stakeholders involved, establish long-term research relationships, build multidisciplinary team and individual capacity, and enable the collaborators to become more effective partners in research and development related to water. Data-driven decisions, actions, and results are key to providing water for multiple and competing users. The water data collected will be the basis for an Armenian Water Resources Research Center as the collaboration continues beyond the timeline of this project. Research finding and the recommendations will be integrated into the education component of ICARE as short-term training courses or elective courses for undergraduate or graduate level students.",

    "description": "Riverscape genetics, or the influence of hydrographic features on the genetics and ecology of lentic and lotic populations, is a young discipline (Selkoe et al. 2016). There have been several temperate riverscape studies with a few tropical studies, being limited mostly to the Amazon and Australia. Very little is known about the population genetics of fishes in the Mekong River Basin (MRB), which is characterized by complicated hydrographic features, including wide seasonal fluctuations in flow (Mekong River Commission 2005, Chea et al. 2016) and numerous changes experienced and expected with more than 350 hydropower dams built, under construction, and planned (Winemiller et al. 2016). This PEER project will support the completion of population genetic studies of 14 species across 26 MRB locations from Myanmar to the Vietnam delta. This will augment information on 2 species collected and analyzed during during the PI’s project in PEER Cycle 2, add new localities to species initiated in a project on which she was co-PI in PEER Cycle 3, and add an additional 6 species not already initiated in previous PEER projects. Advanced genomic analyses will continue to be conducted on data collected using restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) data. These analyses will provide important information on the population structure, effective population size, and directionality of gene flow to substantially add to our knowledge of the natural history of Mekong River fishes. The extent of collection sites throughout the Lower Mekong Basin and the number of species in this study provide the basis for the first ever comparative riverscape genetic analysis of fishes of tropical Southeast Asia.\n \n To ensure that the scientific information to be developed is available to and useful for resource managers, outreach will take place in conjunction with all field and annual meeting activities throughout this project. This will include seminars followed by roundtable discussions to introduce and understand how these analyses can be used and the consequences of disrupting the present population structure. The outreach efforts will target resource managers and development planners in governmental, intergovernmental, non-governmental, and academic institutions in the region, with particular emphasis on those involved in hydropower development projects. This project will also build on the need to create stronger regional collaborations for a better knowledge base to inform decision making by solidifying collaborations initiated during the PEER Cycle 3 project. This will be done by expanding the work done by collaborators in each of the four Lower Mekong Basin existing partner countries (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam) and expanding this to Myanmar by including for the first time a collection component in that country. This new PEER project will add the University of Mandalay, Myanmar, to the network and will aim to build the advanced genomic capacity of all collaborative institutions to the level currently enjoyed at Nha Trang University.",

    "description": "The agricultural production system in the charlands of Bangladesh is characterized by rainfed cultivation, low nutrient levels in the soil, the raising of traditional crop varieties with conventional management practices, poor access to agricultural technologies and services, poor linkage to markets, and low cropping system intensification and diversification. In addition, charlands agriculture is highly prone to climatic stresses (flood, drought, salinity, river and coastal erosion, moisture stress, and tropical cyclones), and local farmers suffer losses every year. The changing climate will amplify these problems in the future and make charland livelihoods precarious. The adoption and adaptation of climate-smart agriculture options (such as different crops or varieties, cropping systems, or management practices) can significantly reduce the negative effects of and build resilience to changing environmental conditions. Not all these climate-smart options, however, are appropriate for every location. Their use is determined by several factors, such as biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics, climate conditions, technological suitability to the local ecosystem, farmers’ perceptions and behavior, market systems, and economic viability. \n \n The charland areas have been largely neglected by the government and development agencies and hence such information is often lacking. The main objectives of this project are to understand charland characteristics and the livelihoods of local residents, examine households’ vulnerability and adaptation to changing conditions, and promote climate-smart agricultural technologies in charlands. To achieve these objectives, the project team will select three charland sites representing flood-, drought-, and salinity-prone ecosystems. In the representative study sites, the project will conduct baseline, endline, and special purpose surveys; analyze factors determining adoption of climate-smart technologies; assess economic viability (profitability and risk) of existing and new cropping systems; test and evaluate climate-smart technologies; and recommend economically viable and demand-demand climate-smart technologies for dissemination.

    "description": "The effectiveness of applying 7.1% chlorhexidine digluconate (delivering 4% chlorhexidine) on the umbilical cord stump to prevent umbilical cord sepsis and neonatal death has been proven through community‐based clinical trials in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan. In Bangladesh, however, chlorhexidine is not widely used in the rural areas, as most deliveries are performed by untrained birth attendants, who apply unhygienic substances such as turmeric, boric powder, mustard oil, ash, coconut oil, ginger, chewed rice, and even cow dung on the umbilical cord stump. It is necessary to build awareness and motivate pregnant mothers, their family members, community members, and traditional birth attendants (TBAs) to change these practices in order to prevent neonatal umbilical cord sepsis. No community intervention has been implemented to train and motivate the above mentioned groups to use chlorhexidine for neonatal umbilical cord care. To address this gap, the research team will conduct a pretest/post-test quasi-experimental study for 18 months in Jamalpur, Bangladesh. It will include a baseline survey, community intervention, and a post-intervention. The rate of chlorhexidine use; rate of umbilical cord sepsis; and knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the respondents will be assessed during the baseline survey. Awareness building and knowledge development intervention will occur through household and community Behavioral Change Communication (BCC) activities. After the intervention, data on the post-intervention rate of chlorhexidine use; rate of neonatal umbilical cord infections; and knowledge, attitude, and practices of the respondents on neonatal umbilical cord care and cord sepsis will be collected through survey. The sources of chlorhexidine distribution in the community will also be assessed during the survey. \n \n The study will build awareness among pregnant mothers, their family members, other community members, TBAs, and pharmacy personnel on umbilical cord infections and the effectiveness of using 4% chlorhexidine to prevent sepsis. These interventions will eventually help in achieving development goals for child health by reducing under-five mortality. The anticipated outcomes will be improved awareness on neonatal umbilical cord care in the selected rural Bangladeshi community and increased utilization of chlorhexidine in the community for neonatal umbilical cord care. The study will result in community mobilization by engaging the community stakeholders, leaders, and TBAs to prevent umbilical cord sepsis by using chlorhexidine for newborn cord care. Involving the TBAs in the intervention will cover both formal and informal healthcare providers for a multifaceted developmental approach.",

    "name": "PEER - Ecosystem Services in a changing climate; assessing critical services in Bangladesh rice production landscapes\n PEER 6-010",
    "description": "Rice contributes more than 80% of the total food supply in Bangladesh, including 76% of daily caloric intake and 66% of total protein requirements (Brolley 2015; Bhuiyan et al. 2002). The coastal region of Bangladesh, which covers 20% of the country and more than 30% of the cultivable land and contributes 16% of the total rice production, is the most vulnerable region to climate change (Minar et al. 2013). Moreover, due to increasingly variable rainfall leading to a reduction in freshwater flows, about 53% of the coastal areas are experiencing salinity intrusions that restrict crop production (Rahman 2012). As a consequence, rice productivity in this area is 70% lower than the national average. In this project, Dr. Ali and his colleagues will quantify the potential impacts of changing conditions on ecosystem services by quantitatively determining the impact of climate variability on the provision of four key ecosystem services: carbon sequestration, pest suppression, water supply, and rice production. They will use spatially explicit models to project future patterns of terrestrial ecosystems and the production and values of ecosystem services. The scientific understanding of the links between climate, ecosystems, and economic value is still unknown or poorly developed for Bangladesh. Therefore, this collaborative research effort involving U.S. experts focused on developing models and estimating the impacts of changing conditions on ecosystem services in Bangladesh will be an important tool for reversing current and future losses in the economic value of Bangladesh’s natural ecosystems.\n \n The area where the project will be conducted is characterized by lower rice productivity due to limited ecosystem services. Therefore, identification of the ecosystem services that induce lower rice production and those that are predicted to be most vulnerable to environmental change in the future is a critical component of enhancing productivity in the region. In this project, the research team will analyze environmental impacts on crop production systems and suggest appropriate coping strategies and adaptation options for improving coastal agriculture, both for increased agricultural production and for better livelihoods for the vulnerable farming community. As a whole, this project will not only provide the scientific community with evidence to overcome anecdotal information, a hindrance to effective ecosystem service monitoring and management, but also aid sustainable ecosystem management implementation and policy interventions.",

    "description": "The main advantages of photogrammetry based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) compared to traditional aircraft imaging campaigns are low cost and flexibility. In addition, aircraft-based image acquisition usually requires months of planning and must cover a substantial area to justify the cost. UAVs can be deployed at a moment’s notice and require practically no maintenance. They can also be deployed at easily customizable above-canopy altitude, camera orientation, trajectory, and speed. They are thus ideal for imaging small areas of forests, such as over individual tree stands, management units or inventory plots (Gatziolis et al., 2015). Most developing countries do not yet have the capacity or knowledge base to support modern forest inventories and typically depend on satellite imagery and applications developed elsewhere to meet their needs, including the obligation to report on the status of their forests if they participate in the international REDD initiative. Satellite-based assessment is adequate in many instances—for example, to assess deforestration in the Amazon basin. It can be problematic and biased, however, when the anthropogenic interventions and ensuing disturbances are either gradual or have a spatial footprint much smaller than the resolution of the satellite imagery employed. The advent of novel, inexpensive technologies, including UAVs, and the development of affordable software capable of performing complex photogrammetric tasks hold promising potential into assisting the assessment of forest resources in developing countries and facilitating their verifiable participation in efforts to mitigate the effects of deforestation and forest degradation.\n \n In this project, the PI and his team will devise and optimize a fully-automated UAV-based image acquisition protocol compatible with generating comprehensive (gap-free), high-density, precisely georefenced point clouds representing forest canopies for areas centered on selected locations in the Sal and Sundarbans forest types that host national forest inventory plots of the Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD). The researchers will generate canopy surface and canopy height rasters for each selected inventory plot and its surroundings, as well as estimates of canopy cover for each subplot of every selected inventory plot, and compare them to those obtained by inventory personnel during field visits. Using the data they will gather, they will develop forest type-specific models of forest biomass and outline a framework for forest change detection and quantification based on periodic satellite imagery and incorporating UAV-derived information over selected areas. Methodologies, findings, and results will be shared with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, representatives of the U.S. Government technical cooperative program SilvaCarbon in Bangladesh, BFD officials, and ultimately the public.",

    "description": "The Amazon is one the most biodiverse regions in the world, yet it is under threat from human encroachment and global climate change. Biodiversity research has focused mostly on vertebrates, paying less attention to other taxa that are arguably more important for ecosystem health and function, such as insects. This is especially true of ants, which are incredibly species-rich, ecologically diverse, and have the highest biomass of any animal in the Neotropics. Ants are key ecosystem engineers, contain many different guilds, and are often highly sensitive to environmental perturbation, which makes them ideal bioindicators. Using ecologically relevant bioindicators allows highly sensitive insight into rapid changes in habitat health and ecosystem function. Unfortunately, a taxonomic impediment limits their use, since many tropical species are undescribed or new to science, greatly slowing morphological species identification. This research study seeks to address this shortcoming by conducting an inventory of ant diversity using DNA sequence data. The collected samples will form the nucleus for a growing entomology collection at the Universidade Federal do Paraná (UFPR), which will be developed into an active research collection to support the study of systematics, biodiversity, and natural history of the ant fauna of the Amazon and Brazil.\n \n Ants contain several important tropical agricultural pests and invasive species. The project will thus be important for Brazilian agriculture and food security as potential pest species will be identified. Assessment of ant biodiversity at various levels and assigning species to functional guilds will lay the baseline for continued monitoring of ecosystem health and biodiversity under climate change, and will help inform conservation decisions by allowing rapid and efficient appraisal of ecosystems. The development of cheap and rapid genetic identification tools is expected to have immediate and lasting impact on biodiversity assessment and conservation practices in the Amazon. Coupling genetic and species-level biodiversity assessments with ecological functional information will improve economic valuation and management impact of ecosystems. This will strengthen environmental governance and advance sustainable management of natural resources and biodiversity conservation in the face of environmental and global climate change. The use of genetic markers will allow in-depth understanding of pest and bioindicator population genetics and dynamics, which are important considerations when developing and applying control or conservation management plans. Additionally, the generation of high-throughput DNA barcoding and next-generation population genomic data will form the foundation for cutting-edge science, technology, and innovation in conservation genetics and bio control and will provide a long-term investment for the PI Dr. Feitosa to develop and train genomic capacity in Brazil.",

    "name": "PEER - Functional diversity of interrelated photosynthesis and water use of Central Amazonian trees PEER-4-445",
    "description": "This project will generate novel understanding on the diversity of plant traits related to water use and photosynthesis. The functional diversity present in a given community is a key dimension of biodiversity that effectively modulates how forests respond to disturbances, such as logging, precipitation, and temperature extremes or the increase in carbon dioxide concentration. It also determines the extent of the feedback between forest and climate, therefore informing us on possible consequences of forest mortality or land use change. To better predict the resilience of the forest and its capacity to provide ecosystem services, it is essential to evaluate the current spectrum of functional diversity, still a major unknown component in biodiversity research. Dr. Domingues and his colleagues will use a new approach looking at the carbon and water cycles as fundamentally coupled at both the leaf and tree level. In order to achieve a qualitative and quantitative assessment of water and carbon strategies by Amazonian trees, they will continuously monitor both the transport of water in tree trunks and the continuous expansion and contraction of the tree’s bole diameter, which relates to water storage, mobilization of photosynthetic products, and growth. This will be complemented by leaf-level measurements of photosynthetic apparatus and hydraulics to comprehend the individual link of photosynthesis with water usage. This novel dataset will demonstrate the coupling between transport of water and carbon within trees and how it relates to forest productivity. The new data will be applied to broader scales by using land-surface and ecosystem models to simulate the interaction between forest and atmosphere at different scenarios of functional diversity. This step will be achieved by collaboration with U.S. Government-supported partner Pierre Gentine, who is implementing a soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum model able to reproduce the carbon and water relationship in the Community Land Model. Brazilian students will also receive much-needed training in computational modeling. \n \n The proposed research will shed light on the role of biodiversity not only in maintaining and improving quality of life for inhabitants of the Amazon region but also for improving water security in other areas. By characterizing current variability in water and carbon use strategies expressed by Amazonian trees, it is possible to assess how much biodiversity loss within this group is tolerable, without seriously compromising ecosystem functioning. The information to be generated by this project will help in evaluating ecosystem integrity in areas where disturbance has already occurred. For example, it will be possible to assess disparities between pristine forest and secondary vegetation, in terms of ecosystem response to water stress whether from bottom up (soil to leaves induced by dry soil conditions) or top down (from leaves to soil induced by dry or hot weather conditions), according to species composition of the community. As a result, plant communities can be evaluated in terms of resilience to further climatic extremes. The products of this research will also aid in guiding species selection for vegetation restoration efforts. For example, such information will be of great value to local community initiatives focusing on production of tree saplings for reforestation programs or ecosystem improvement actions.",

    "name": "PEER - History and diversification of floodplain forest bird communities in Amazonia: towards an integrated conservation plan\n PEER5-009",
    "description": "The research proposed here is crucial, given that Amazonian countries are focusing on building hydroelectric dams, which will impose a significant impact to the biota specialized in flooded habitats through habitat loss, fragmentation, and changes in sediment dynamics. This biota has a unique, complex, and still poorly known history, as wetlands probably dominated western Amazonia for a large portion of the Neogene, and significant changes on the drainage pattern have occurred since then. Although birds are one of the best-known groups of vertebrates, flooded habitat bird assemblages are still poorly known and have been very little explored using molecular techniques. Based on the dynamic history of flooded habitats (with their frequent cycles of building and erosion due to sedimentary processes), bird species from these habitats were assumed to have high dispersal ability and consequently to lack genetic structure. However, recent studies of phenotypic and genomic variation have shown that this is not the case. Substantial cryptic diversity and endemism have been found within some of these taxa, which indicates that patterns and processes underlying these patterns are not well understood. Within the context of the developmental plans for energy generation, this constitutes a major threat to a significant portion of Amazonian biodiversity that is little known. Dr. Ribas and her colleagues will generate a multidisciplinary dataset, including genomic, ecologic, and spatial biotic and abiotic data that will be integrated to (1) advance our knowledge on the evolution of Amazonian flooded habitats and their biota and (2) provide information that can be used for assessing the impact of proposed hydroelectric dams and for identifying areas of conservation priority. This will be accomplished in collaboration with the NSF-funded project led by Dr. Cracraft, which aims to reconstruct the history and evolution of the Amazonian biota and its environment, focusing mainly on the upland forest biota, and will provide background information on methods and analysis, as well as complementary data. \n \n Hydroelectric energy generation is considered a source of clean and renewable energy, but current environmental impact assessments ignore the long-term irreversible impacts that dams have on Amazonian flooded habitats. There are 121 established, and 303 planned, dams for the Amazon region, most of them in Brazil. In the Amazonian lowlands, 51 dams already exist and 130 more are planned. Among the ten largest planned dams, three are built or nearing completion: Santo Antônio and Jirau (Madeira River) and Belo Monte (Xingu River). The remaining seven are still in planning stages, reinforcing the need for immediate attention to the impacts of these projects. Most planned dams in the Amazonian lowlands will adopt the “run of the river” system, in which large extensions of flooded habitat are kept permanently flooded, submerging river islands and disrupting the hydrologic cycle. The resulting loss of species in flooded habitats may impact the upland biota as well, as taxa from both habitats are interconnected by ecological processes, and thus have important consequences for large portions of Amazonian protected areas and indigenous lands, affecting availability of resources for both the ecosystem and traditional and indigenous communities. To assess the impact of planned dams on the Amazonian biota it is essential to understand the history and distribution of flooded habitats’ biological diversity, as well as the importance of the hydrological cycle in developing and maintaining this diversity. For this, an interdisciplinary framework is necessary that considers the evolution of the current landscape and its possible responses to the dams. Dr. Ribas has assembled a multidisciplinary team that will study population genomics, ecological affinities, biological diversification, and species distribution patterns for flooded habitat birds and relate these patterns to spatial distribution and chronology of flooded habitats, sediment dynamics responsible for building or erosion of flooded substrates, and hydrology of the most threatened Amazonian basins. As a result, they expect to produce and disseminate data and integrative analytical methods that will inform environmental impact assessments related to planning and execution of developmental projects taking place in the future and especially over the coming decade in Brazil.",

    "description": "Deforestation is among the most important alterations occurring in tropical systems and is responsible for unprecedented losses of plant and animal biodiversity. However, little is known about the impact of land use change and seasonal inundation of wetlands on microbial biodiversity, especially in the tropics. In previous research, Dr. Moura and his colleagues discovered that soil microbial biodiversity in Amazon rainforest soil is homogenized and reduced by forest-to-agriculture conversion. However, it remains unknown how such changes in microbial biodiversity affect ecosystem functions. This challenge is paralleled by our need to understand, and ultimately manage, the problem of global climate change. This project addresses the intersection of these two questions in the context of biodiversity conservation by asking: “how does the interaction between soil microbial and forest tree biodiversity control cycling of the powerful greenhouse gas methane along gradients of land use and seasonal water inundation in Amazon forests?” To predict the future of methane as a driver of climate change in this system, the researchers will combine novel gas flux measurement instrumentation with cutting-edge molecular microbial ecology. They will address biodiversity and environmental controls on methane production from tropical regions by measuring methane fluxes from a variety of potential sources, including surfaces of tree stems and leaves, soil, and water in forested and deforested areas, as well as upland and wetland areas. Detailed inventories of biodiversity of methane-active vegetation and microbial communities will be performed in the Santarem region of Brazil.\n \n The goals of the project are to advance biodiversity conservation science in Amazônia by (1) quantifying methane-cycling microbial diversity as a function of land use and seasonal inundation, (2) quantifying interactions between methane-cycling microbes and methane cycling, and (3) incorporating knowledge of interactions between methane-cycling microbes and plants into conservation and management plans for mitigating the climate impact of methane emissions. Collaborators from the United States will work with the Brazilian team to analyze and integrate results and ultimately create a model to predict the response of methane cycling to land-use change. This model will not only be useful to a wide community of researchers but will also inform stakeholders and local policy administrators on protecting local biodiversity. The project’s focus on microbial biodiversity as a driver of methane cycling through the twin lenses of land use change and tropical wetlands (the largest natural sources of microbially produced methane to the atmosphere in the world) links development-associated anthropogenic land use change to both biodiversity conservation and climate change feedback. The project will thus bring new knowledge from a novel field (conservation biology for microbes) to our understanding of the impacts of development. Results from this project will provide a basis to inform policy development to simultaneously address problems of biodiversity conservation and management of key economic resource for riverine communities.",

    "name": "PEER - Mapping and Conserving Butterfly Biodiversity in the Brazilian Amazon\n PEER4-478",
    "description": "The Amazon has some of the most diverse biological communities in the world, including butterflies, and recent expeditions by Dr. Freitas and his collaborators have found numerous poorly known or undescribed species. The PI and his team are involved in several projects on butterfly classification and evolution (systematics), but the Amazon is very poorly known in comparison with other regions of Brazil due to its sheer size and difficulties of transport. Given the insufficient knowledge of distribution and biology, conservation of faunas and species is currently not possible for the great majority of butterflies. In this project, the Brazilian research team will collaborate with a National Science Foundation-supported project at the Florida Museum of Natural History on the systematics of euptychiine butterflies, a highly diverse and abundant group in Amazonian forests, to sample new regions, build collections and provide vital capacity for research and conservation of Brazilian Amazonian butterflies. The researchers will compile data from numerous sources, including literature, databases, and specimens in major world museums, to improve our knowledge of Amazonian butterfly distribution. Poorly known groups or those containing species with restricted distributions, which are important both for understanding evolution and for conservation, will be targeted. A major goal of the project is to conduct up to eight expeditions to poorly sampled or unexplored areas of the Brazilian Amazon, including access by boat or light aircraft. Approximately 20,000 specimens will be collected during these expeditions, and these will be processed and databased. Mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase 1 (COI) genes will be sequenced for some specimens to enable identification of cryptic species, where morphology alone is inconclusive. \n \n Deforestation, exploitation for oil and gas, and climate change all threaten Brazilian Amazon biological communities. Butterflies are used as indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem health, as monitors of climate change, and as key species in biodiversity conservation. Butterfly distribution data therefore have great potential in identifying priority areas for conservation of Amazonian biodiversity, as has been done in many temperate countries. With the Brazilian Amazon playing a vital role in controlling South American and global climate, such data also provide a baseline for measuring future climate change in the region. This project will build capacity for research on Brazilian Amazonian butterflies by training graduate students and a postdoc and by strengthening collaborations among researchers and students in Brazil and with foreign institutions. The project will build substantial collections and online resources for future taxonomic, biogeographic, and conservation research, including enhancing major Brazilian butterfly collections with new material, archiving tissue samples for DNA study, and databasing specimens. The data collected will also be made available online via iDigBio, a major initiative for aggregating specimen data and sharing it with the public.",

    "name": "PEER - Monitoring the disturbance of the microbiota in Amazonian soils during conversion of forest to pasture and its consequences on cattle health\n PEER4-299",
    "description": "Pandemics of “swollen face,” a bacterial-origin periodontitis disease afflicting ruminant livestock, have been correlated with deforested areas in Brazil (Döbereiner et al., 2000). This disease, which is also known as \"lumpy face,\" was commonly reported in Brazil during the 1960s and 1980s. New cases have recently been observed in sheep and goat flocks in the Amazon, under the same epidemiological conditions and with the same characteristics observed in bovines. In such circumstances, the disease has destroyed herds of livestock, often up to 90% of the animals. Dr. Jesus and his project collaborators hypothesize a link between the “swollen face” disease and shifts in the soil microbial communities as a consequence of deforestation and pasture introduction. This belief is based on previous evidence showing that this disease is triggered by deforestation, which in turn leads to significant changes in the soil communities, favoring specific populations such as actinomycetes. The team’s objective is to characterize correlations between the soil environment, changes in the microbial community due to deforestation, and the occurrence of this disease. Once more specific correlations are identified, they will experimentally test hypotheses (e.g., causation) generated through isolating key microbes and using culture-dependent and independent techniques. Answering these questions is important to advance towards a cure for the disease and design monitoring methods and alternative management to reduce its incidence. Additionally, confirming the link between the occurrence of diseases, deforestation, and changes in biodiversity will contribute to the delineation of policies to hinder deforestation and to promote biodiversity conservation. As part of the effort, the U.S. Government-supported partner, Dr. James Cole, will provide training and support with bioinformatic analysis of the datasets, sharing analytical tools he uses in his own research. \n \nThe world’s growing population and their increasing demand for animal protein raises concerns over the pressure for the creation of new pastures to meet this demand, especially in countries like Brazil, which is the world’s leading beef exporter. New pastures are created at the expense of native lands, including the Brazilian Amazon. In fact, pasture introduction is the major driver of deforestation in the region, and alternatives to reduce this pressure are needed. Within this context, this project can contribute with information to support policymakers in their decisions, as well as to create alternatives to the sustainable management of pre-existing pasture lands. The results of this project may also contribute to designing sustainable, innovative management systems, such as the integrated crop-livestock-forest system, which has been recognized by FAO, the Ministry of Agriculture of Brazil, and Embrapa as an alternative to stimulate the use of pre-existing pasture lands, guarantee food and agricultural security, and discourage the deforestation of new areas for agriculture and livestock production.",

    "name": "PEER - Where is my Turtle? Quantifying biodiversity impacts of hydroelectric expansion and river use changes in the Brazilian Amazon\n PEER4-123",
    "description": "Semi-aquatic species are impacted by hydroelectric developments and river use changes, and to engage multiple stakeholders (from children to local landowners to electricity companies) Dr. Norris and his colleagues chose to focus on conservation of the river turtle Podocnemis unifilis within a unique socioeconomic development scenario (Amapa State). P. unifilis represent provisioning (food, source of income) and cultural services for Amazon populations (Vogt 2008), and unlike charismatic mammal species like the Giant Otter (Michalski et al. 2012), river turtles do not generate negative perceptions in local human populations (Norris & Michalski 2013). Additionally, river turtles depend on both terrestrial (nesting) and aquatic (feeding/reproduction) environments, which provides multiple opportunities for achieving engagement, research, and biodiversity conservation objectives. In sum, river turtles are thus ideal biodiversity conservation “flagship” species that deliver important ecosystem services and elicit strong affinity in people for the conservation of wild species and their habitats. However, no previous study has robustly quantified a P. unifilis population. A variety of approaches have been used but none incorporate detectability. As such, previous studies only provided estimates of minimum or maximum numbers, which are not suitable for comparison (Norris et al. 2011) and are not associated with population parameters required to inform conservation actions. By integrating data from multiple techniques this project team aims to provide a robust assessment of P. unifilis movements and demographics.\n \n The participation and integration of local schools, regional post-graduate courses, lecturers, researchers, students, and local people from riverine communities will transfer knowledge and help to create new practices and innovative educational techniques. Conservation solutions will be generated by integrating multiple stakeholders as research participants in an advanced and robust biodiversity conservation program in the most completely protected state of the Brazilian Amazon. This project will also contribute directly to six National Biodiversity Conservation targets in Brazil.",

    "description": "This project addresses an unsolved problem in the field of emerging diseases: What are the proximal effects of large-scale deforestation on the transmission of vector-borne infectious diseases? The principal investigator and his team will approach this problem by studying malaria in natural populations of rainforest birds threatened by rapid environmental degradation in Cameroon. It is well established that deforestation poses a major threat to biodiversity in tropical regions; however, its effects on the spread of pathogens are largely uncharacterized. The team has previously identified malaria parasites, both generalists and specialists, in African rainforest birds, and they have found that it is the generalists that have the potential to jump to naïve hosts and develop as emerging diseases. They have also identified mosquito vectors of avian malaria and demonstrated that patterns of malaria diversity are significantly affected by habitat. With their knowledge of sectors presently zoned for logging, they thus have in place an unprecedented model system for investigating the effects of environmental change on disease transmission. They will test the hypotheses that (1) deforestation promotes an increase in ther prevalence of generalist parasites and (2) vector species distributions change with deforestation, and account for differences in prevalence of generalist vs. specialist parasites. The ultimate goal of this research is to discern the interplay among hosts, habitat, and vector ecology on the potential spread of novel pathogen strains. Another important objective is to determine how human-altered environments affect the feeding patterns of insect vectors and what environmental factors are important in determining likelihood of transmission. By applying the same type of relations before and after logging, they researchers should be able to predict where the vectors are likely to occur, where disease is likely to occur, and the patterns may change. This work will capitalize on the U.S. Government-supported partner’s expertise in molecular biology, parasitology, entomology, and fieldwork and leverages the archive of blood samples that the he and his collaborators have accrued over nearly 30 years from African rainforest birds.",

The main goals include (1) estimating river discharge from the Dique Canal-Magdalena River system into Cartagena Bay by applying satellite-derived measurements; (2) relating the constructed river flow series since 1998 to identify climate variability and human impacts for the Magdalena River basin; (3) making satellite-based data available as GIS files so they can be incorporated into end-user decision-support systems; and (4) developing capacity building for implementing satellite-based river freshwater estimations in environmental decision making in Cartagena Bay.\n \n Findings on Cartagena Bay’s pollution and its current inadequacy for recreational use and fish consumption are widely known within the scientific community. In addition, lack of reliable data on freshwater discharge flowing into the bay has limited detailed modeling and applied science on how river fluxes impact physical and chemical characteristics of coastal waters. The ambiguity of the problem means that mitigation strategies are lacking. This PEER project team aims to have a significant impact by generating a clearer and more precise foundation of knowledge on continental runoff fluxes and related marine pollution problems, which could thus inform the development of adaptive strategies at both the community and political level. The planned collaboration between the Dartmouth Flood Observatory at the University of Colorado and EAFIT University-Colombia, the latter with its current project in the region, BASIC-Cartagena (Basin Sea Interaction with Communities), will serve as a joint effort in strengthening the capacity of regional stakeholders to integrate geospatial and satellite products into development and decision making, with the final goal of improving environmental management for Cartagena Bay.",

    "description": "This study uses an Ecosystem Services approach to generate information for land use planning within the context of climate change adaption. This approach uses science-based indicators that classify ecosystems and their function and potential services in order to evaluate the influence of social, economic, and environmental service flows on human well-being, with the ultimate goal of guiding land-use planning. Reducing the impacts of urbanization and climate change has been a primary target of ecosystem services research, but research activity of this type in the tropics has been limited. The iTree is a public domain model provided by the USDA Forest Service and is used to aid planners and managers in the valuation and management of urban forests by quantifying the ecosystem services they provide. Although the iTree tool has been widely in many U.S. cities and internationally, its use in the Caribbean has been very limited as well. The proposed project will assist in gathering scientific information that can be readily used to set ecosystem function and services management goals and evaluate climate change scenarios that are appropriate for tropical ecosystem context, thus expanding the iTree model. Additionally, this project will establish an innovative collaborative platform that integrates multiple scientific disciplines with outreach and education towards greater understanding of urban infrastructure and sustainability.\n \n Like many small island nations, the Dominican Republic is vulnerable to climate-related impacts, including sea level rise, flooding, heat, prolonged droughts, and disruptions in water supply. Urban areas, such as Santo Domingo, are of particular concern because of their greater population and their exposure to watershed-level risks such as urban flooding and water quality issues. The Municipality of Santo Domingo, in partnership with the Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo (INTEC), USAID, and the USDA Forest Service, is developing adaptation strategies, including the use of green infrastructure to control flooding. However, there is a great need for tools to evaluate and prioritize green infrastructure strategies and impacts in hydrological function for cities. \n \n This team will use the iTree tool to assess and manage forests and their faunal communities and link urban forest management to environmental quality and community livability. Dr. Bonilla and her team will work closely with iTree Forest Service scientists to apply the tool to understand the quality and distribution of urban green infrastructure and its capacity to provide ecosystem-based adaptation services in the Santo Domingo area. Specifically, they will 1) perform an inventory of common green spaces combining field surveys and landscape-level remote-sensing data; 2) carry out an inventory of woody and wildlife species using a stratified sampling method of common green spaces following Forest Service inventory and wildlife survey protocols; and 3) implement iTree tools to model the degree of ecosystem service provision by existing green infrastructure. The outcomes of this project should positively impact planning and implementation by building local capacity in the evaluation of urban forests, as the team plans several workshops and training events for local managers, decision-makers, and stakeholders on iTree.",

    "description": "The overarching aim of this project is to develop and disseminate an evidence-based healthcare professional training program to counsel smokers (both men and women) to stop smoking and establish smoke-free homes via developing the capacity of physicians and nurses who counsel pregnant women in greater Cairo. The intervention target group includes pregnant mothers in households with a current smoker. This will help to achieve better maternal and child health outcomes through women either quitting smoking and/or establishing a smoke-free home. The project team also aims to create capacity for widespread dissemination by developing and testing a train-the-trainer program and creating a network of professionals and organizations, including the Ministry of Health. The proposed intervention is capitalizing on the “teachable moment concept,” with health professionals providing advice in a situation where men and women alike are likely more receptive for behavioral change interventions that can affect the health of their unborn baby. The intervention includes the following activities: (1) developing and implementing a core training curriculum for physicians and nurses to be implemented in antenatal care visits; (2) creating capacity for dissemination by developing a train-the-trainer model and adapting a health/social service-based follow-up protocol to be implemented by the nursing staff; and (3) developing a monitoring and evaluation plan for core program activities and follow-up activities by the trainers. \n \n This project has multiple development implications in Egypt. The direct improvement in the health and well-being of pregnant women and children should have a positive economic impact . Tobacco use has indirect effects on health by increasing the risk of poverty at the individual, household, and national levels. The capacity building components of this project are also directed towards empowering young investigators in the field of science and research to help prepare future leaders in those fields.

    "name": "PEER - Promoting Resource- Oriented Sanitation in Peri-urban Ethiopia through the Production of Struvite from Digested Sludge Filtrate\n PEER 6-400",
    "description": "Ethiopia has become one of the fastest growing economies in Africa, with an increasing rate of urbanization and demand for phosphate-based fertilizer to increase productivity in the agriculture sector. Phosphate rock, the starting material for phosphate fertilizer, is a finite resource, and Ethiopia is entirely dependent on importing different kinds of phosphate fertilizers and therefore is vulnerable to market fluctuations in fertilizer prices. The availability and affordability of imported fertilizers to most of the urban and peri-urban farmers is very low because of lack of government subsidies for urban/peri-urban farmers, unlike those provided for rural farmers. The urban/peri-urban farmers get fertilizers at a higher price from local vendors, and the product is difficult to get at any cost at times of shortage. This scenario suggests the need to look for alternative sources of phosphate to achieve sustainable agriculture. Recovery of phosphorus from digested sludge water has long been a well-established technology in some of the developed countries. Different technologies are available to recover phosphorus from various wastewater streams. Some have been implemented at an industrial scale with maximum recovery efficiency. So far, Ethiopia has not adopted any phosphorus recovery technologies at any level. \n \n This PEER project is aimed at demonstrating that digested wastewater can be used to reliably produce good quality, safe, and marketable struvite fertilizer using full-scale systems. The focus of the study will be on preferred approaches for recovery of phosphorus and nitrogen from digested wastewater with the minimum prevalence of various types of contaminants, such as micropollutants (drugs and metabolites) and biological contaminants (microorganisms and antibiotic resistance genes). The information generated about the prevalence and persistence of the pollutants will be useful in further risk assessment studies to predict the risks associated with wastewater reuse. The lab facilities accessible through collaboration with the U.S. partner will be useful for the initial survey of these contaminants from the fertilizer product (struvite) and its raw material, and the information generated will leverage subsequent in-house monitoring studies. The project will also demonstrate the impact of struvite on commonly grown vegetables, such as carrot and Ethiopian kale, as compared with synthetic fertilizer, which has further implications for addressing issues of food insecurity in the urban areas. The researcher team plans to work in close collaboration with smallholder farmers of urban and peri-urban areas to understand problems of productivity, the perception of struvite by farmers, and impact of struvite application in the productivity of urban agriculture. Through this approach, the particular needs and challenges of women farmers will also be addressed.",

    "name": "PEER -Bringing seasonal forecasts to the farmer: participatory climate smart villages for Green Growth in Ethiopia (PEER 5-194)",
    "description": "Climate change adaptation is a high priority for Ethiopia and other climate-vulnerable countries. At the farm and village level, however, long-term planning for climate change means very little. Subsistence agriculture communities survive on a year-to-year basis, and the productivity of the coming season’s crops is typically too important and is often too uncertain to allow for adaptation planning on the decades-long time horizon of climate change projections. In this context, improved use of seasonal forecasts offers a climate resilience building strategy that pays dividends under current conditions and is likely to become even more essential as patterns of climate variability shift in coming years. The use of seasonal forecasts is also flexible and adaptable to context in a way that few adaptation strategies are. A specific cropping technology or seed variety may not work across agroecosystems, but improved approaches to interpreting and acting on seasonal climate forecasts can contribute to resilience in a wide range of settings.\n \n The guiding principle for this project is that seasonal forecasts generated at the agroecosystem level, developed collaboratively with farmers, will advance understanding of the adaptation process and contribute to climate resilience in subsistence-based communities. The proposed work would leverage and expand a climate smart village (CSV) network that has proven to be an effective mechanism to engage farmers in generating climate resilience solutions. The CSVs will inform application of forecasts through participatory forecast interpretation and communication. They will also provide a platform for linking forecasts to culturally and ecologically appropriate actions to make use of forecast information. Meanwhile, the project focus on best-available seasonal forecasts will add a dimension of capabilities to CSVs that is currently absent.",

    "description": "In 2015, the average Ethiopian woman had a 1 in 64 lifetime risk of death due to complications of childbirth, and 87,414 newborns died before their 28th day of life. Reducing maternal and neonatal deaths has been at the top of the global health agenda for more than a decade and was recently included in Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Demand for maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) services, however, still remains low in Ethiopia’s rural communities most at risk. Complex challenges, including transportation, health literacy, imbalanced decision-making authority, and harmful traditional practices, create barriers to increasing health coverage.\n \n This implementation science study will utilize an integrated delivery approach to increase demand for MNCH services in the Gondar region of Ethiopia. The research design aims to address primary drivers of maternal and neonatal death, including access to antenatal care, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), facility-based delivery, and postpartum visits through a culturally driven lens. The goal of the project is to improve MNCH outcomes in rural Ethiopia by increasing demand for services through the linkage of local health workers and community influencers. The study team will collect and analyze qualitative data to establish a baseline for women’s engagement with their health facilities, identify barriers to accessing MNCH services, and parse out traditional practices and beliefs around childbirth and infant health, including religious rituals. From the baseline information, a behavior change intervention will be implemented in which community leaders from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church will be paired with members of the Health Development Army (HDA) and trained to conduct maternal and child health outreach and education. Strategies for transporting laboring and postpartum women to health facilities will be devised and implemented by the local communities. The study team will develop a clear monitoring and evaluation plan at the outset of the study, including tracking time to seeking care, frequency of seeking care, removal of barriers to care, and measures of morbidity and mortality. The study hypothesis is that there will be an increase in demand for MNCH services following the intervention, with targeted increases in the uptake of antenatal care, PMTCT, facility-based delivery, and postnatal care and referral. It is expected that the impact of increased engagement with health facilities will decrease maternal and neonatal deaths in the study population compared to the control group.",

The incorporation of aflatoxin resistant genes into local elite inbred lines for the production of high yielding hybrids will not only improve maize availability in Ghana but will also improve the nutrition and health of Ghanaians. The process of developing aflatoxin-resistant maize will enhance the skills of Ghanaian scientists in using marker-assisted selection/breeding to hasten maize breeding activities in Ghana, and these modern techniques can also be utilized in other breeding activities for improved biotic stress resistance in Ghana and beyond. Currently, the use of marker-assisted breeding is at the initial stages in Ghana, and using aflatoxin-resistant markers will reduce considerably the time needed to breed for high yielding aflatoxin-resistant maize in Ghana.\n \n First of all the development of aflatoxin-resistant maize will not only impact positively on the nutrition of Ghanaians but also will have a tremendous impact on health of mothers, children, poultry, and livestock. Improving maize yields can substantially raise farmers’ income and livelihoods. It will also provide raw material for the poultry industry to increase poultry production and consequently address protein needs of Ghanaians. \n \n Currently, Ghana is not self sufficient in poultry, partly due to the high cost of maize used in poultry feed. Consumption of aflatoxin-contaminated maize also has detrimental effects on unborn babies, child health, child development, and survival. Developing aflatoxin resistant maize will address these challenges thereby enhancing the overall well-being of Ghanaians. In addition, the acquisition of equipment to support marker-assisted selection will improve the technical infrastructure at the Crops Research Institute. \n \n The improved human resource capacity that the project will produce can also deployed to address other stress breeding challenges.",

    "description": "This project will involve collection and analysis of data on students with disabilities and the pedagogical practices of their teachers in areas of Haiti devastated by Hurricane Matthew on October 3, 2016. The Grand Anse, Nippes, and Southern areas of Haiti suffered massive destruction of all infrastructures, including housing, health, transportation, and education; many people in these areas of Haiti had probably already been devastated by the severe earthquake in January 2010. While there are ongoing efforts to respond to basic needs of survivors, less than two percent of humanitarian aid efforts go to education. Of the humanitarian aid for education, very little is allocated for children with disabilities. In post-earthquake and hurricane reality, meeting basic life needs is difficult for everyone (with or without disabilities) in the best of circumstances. The Haitian Ministry of Education has begun to address the educational needs of those with disabilities, but demographic summaries suggest that less four percent of children with disabilities are registered in school. It is reasonable to expect (but we don’t know) that today the number is even smaller and that children with disabilities are receiving very little education. Given this large area of need, Dr. Lainy and his colleagues will focus their project on expanding known data about youth with disabilities in Haiti. The objectives of this project are to (1) estimate the number of students with disabilities in three departments of Haiti, (2) survey the needs of students with disabilities in these departments, (3) determine services received by these students, and (4) describe the educational context for these students, including resources and practices of teachers and schools.\n \n Since the devastating earthquakes in 2010, Haiti has received $4.2 billion from the U.S. Government to help transition from disaster relief to a long-term development plan. This project will support these goals by building an information infrastructure about the status and needs of those with disabilities in Haiti, many of whom were disabled directly by the disaster events. Expected specific results and outcomes of the project include:\n \n 1. Providing donors and stakeholders (e.g., USAID/Haiti, the Ministry of National Education, NGOs, etc.) with credible and reliable data to guide their actions to increase access to educational activities to youth with disabilities in Haiti\n 2. A description of the causes, symptoms, and impacts of mental and/or motor disabilities among school students in Grand Anse, Nippes, and Southern areas of Haiti\n 3. A description of the limitations of the pedagogy used and the weakness of the available infrastructures\n 4. Increased awareness among teachers, principals, parents, and local authorities regarding the impacts of disabilities\n 5. A set of resources and way forward to assist students with disabilities\n 6.

Sharp fluctuations in production from these non-conventional sources would have an impact on the total performance of the power grid, so in this context it is better to handle predictive maintenance and performance forecasting in a strategic manner. The main objectives of the project are (1) development of a performance evaluation strategy considering all relevant factors, (2) development of standard O&M methods, (3) capacity building of government and private stakeholders for the long-term implementation of the strategies, (4) design of policy recommendations based on the project outcomes, and (5) provision of support for the Government of India to achieve its 2022 solar target. \n \n Documentation of the performance evaluation method and O&M strategies for solar power projects should be useful in measuring performance guarantees, as an assessment of system performance, for verification of the performance model that can be applied to a new system. Although the measurement of this performance metric might appear to be straightforward, there are a number of subtleties associated with variations in weather and imperfect data collection that complicate the determination and data analysis. The performance assessment is most valuable when it is completed with very low uncertainty and when the subtleties are systematically addressed; currently no standard exists to guide this process. In the Indian scenario, a single performances analysis including O&M strategy will not make any difference because of the geographical complexity of the country and the different climate conditions found in each major region. Up to now, there has been no region-specific analysis, development of performance evaluation standards, or creation of O&M manuals in India.\n \n This team's novel approach in performance evaluation and O&M strategy preparation should help to make a direct impact on the methods and strategies used by solar photovoltaic customers and developers during the implementation phase, while the indirect impact will be on government authorities, helping them to adjust policies accordingly. This research should have an impact on technology solutions so as to strengthen power production from solar photovoltaics at both the utility and small captive project scales.",

Understanding the ecological impact of P. juliflora, the feasibility of partially restoring grassland, and the sustainability of P. juliflora harvesting will make it possible to create a model to evaluate adaptive management scenarios for Banni. Banni’s Maldharis have collectively applied for community rights to the landscape under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. This landmark legislation gives local communities the right to manage and conserve landscapes that they have customarily used. The Maldharis’ rich empirical knowledge, combined with a mechanistic understanding of potential management options, would be a powerful tool in their formulation of a Banni management plan. Having a portfolio of livelihood options such as those to be developed under this PEER project could be an advantage to Banni’s Maldharis by helping to reduce their vulnerability to climate change, while at the same time enabling them to manage Banni as a sustainable landscape with enhanced carbon stocks. The project could also serve as a model for similar landscapes not only in India but also in other countries that are the focus of USAID’s Feed the Future efforts.",

This will include training students from Bengkulu University in collecting and processing GPS data to model historical earthquakes in this region and simulate crustal deformation for earthquake cycles. They will also investigate tsunami height based on various models. To help prepare for potential future disasters, they will build partnerships among scientists, outreach workers, NGOs, and government officials in order to link science to risk-reduction practice. They will be leveraging the experience of their U.S. Government-supported partner, who has experience in methods of developing community resilience to disaster and policies for earthquake and tsunami hazards mitigation. \n \nThese researchers also plan to integrate earthquake education and curriculum development into their Global Positioning System (GPS) field surveys. Most of the GPS stations they will install will be in schoolyards. Undergraduate faculty-in-training from Bengkulu University will join the GPS field teams to develop, test, and refine lessons about earthquakes and ways to reduce risk. The project team will supervise undergraduate students in designing and implementing “go school” efforts and will also provide science and teaching examples for an NGO-led program to integrate disaster-risk reduction into the Padang city schools’ curriculum. This provides an excellent opportunity for educating local communities about earthquakes because the undergraduates will serve as effective role models for the younger school students, inspiring them to stay in school and encouraging them to study science. The project team will work with the Padang government to present and explain their results, including tsunami and hazard maps, as well as an assessment of potential impacts at the district and city levels.

    "description": "The overarching goal of this project is to explore Indonesia’s rich biodiversity in two different ecosystems, namely peat swamp forests and buffalo manure, to find new enzymes and microbes that can improve the efficiency of converting Indonesia’s abundant biomass residues into energy and other value-added products. Indonesia is one of the world’s top biodiversity hot spots, and its microbial diversity has the potential to be a rich source for various biological products such as novel pharmaceuticals or industrial enzymes. Unfortunately, much of this microbial biodiversity remains unknown to science due to the insufficient research funding and capabilities in Indonesia. This project aims to build technical capabilities in metagenomics research to explore the microbial diversity of Indonesia and build a culture collection to facilitate ex-situ conservation of this microbial diversity. In addition, research will focus on identifying novel enzymes to improve the bioconversion process. Microbial communities living in peat swamp forests and buffalo manure are likely sources of novel enzymes that can break down lignocellulose, the fibrous material in plants. The high proportion of lignin in peat (Factors, 2015) may naturally promote the selection of microbial communities that can degrade or modify lignin. Similarly, a recent study has discovered vast arrays of enzymes that are active on lignocellulosic biomass from buffalo rumen (Duan et al., 2009). As buffaloes can thrive on low-quality feeds that are hard to digest (Bilal et al., 2006), the microflora living in the buffalo rumen are a likely source for enzymes that can effectively break down hard to digest biomass materials. To date, no studies have been done to thoroughly explore the potential of microbial enzymes from these two ecosystems for improving the efficiency of the bioconversion process. As a third objective, the researchers will also work to identify yeasts that can convert lignocellulosic sugars to oil for biofuels.",

    "description": "The policy on peatland restoration in Indonesia is to rewet, requiring a minimum water table of 40 cm below the surface, to avoid future fire and haze episodes. Although rewetting is the most logical and effective means for restoring and conserving the biophysical condition of peatlands, the social and economic perspectives are overlooked. Four constraints to effective tropical peatland management (van Noordwijk et al., 2015) are (1) lack of scientific understanding of peatland and vegetation responses; (2) unwillingness to act by the national and local governments; (3) inability to act within existing legislative and economic realities; and (4) lack of attractive land-use options for smallholders and communities living on the edges of peatlands. With Indonesia’s new restoration policies, significant progress has been made to relieve constraints 2 and 3, but the primary constraints have shifted to 4 and associated parts of 1. This project aims to fill knowledge gaps through rigorous research assessing vegetation responses to drainage and rewetting in a range of disturbed peatland conditions, as current information is not sufficient to evaluate restoration options that have an economic return through utilizing valuable vegetation and fish. A plant ecological (functional traits) approach will be applied to focus on root-system adaptations to survive in wet conditions. Concurrently, the researchers will interview smallholders and the broader community to assess local knowledge, perceptions and preferences for peatland restoration economic development using well-established methods for participatory research.",

The objectives are to address LBWI problems, improve the referral system from community to hospitals and vice versa, promote the sustainability of the KMC for increasing its survival, as well as reduction of both mortality and morbidity. The referral health system has been developed by the Ministry of Health. However, the implementation of this services including LBWI is still a big challenge. Coordination and follow-up of referral services after discharge from hospital is very weak. Through current policy on Universal Coverage of health services (BPJS), there is an opportunity to devise and strengthen the referral health system including cases of LBWI. The design of the study is a before and after intervention and is carried out at the hospital and community levels. The primary target population is families with LBWI born in either the hospital or community setting. In each district, the expected number of mothers with LBWI is estimated at 200 in each hospital, 100 in either primary health centers or private midwife clinics, and another 100 born at home delivery. The total sample will be approximately 800 mothers with LBWI. The secondary target populations are family members, cadres, health care providers, and decision makers. The formative research will be conducted to increase the possibility of an effective, acceptable, and sustainable intervention. Also, it will fine tune the proposed intervention adjusted to the existing condition. A quantitative study will follow with the aim to investigate LBWI survival and morbidity rates. Case fatality rates (CFR) due to major complications and neonatal mortality will be studied retrospectively both at the hospital and community settings. However, both neonatal morbidity and CFR will only be studied at the hospital level. The intervention will consists of Learning Organization, and training for personnel who will be involved in the care of LBWI for KMC and its referral system. An end-line study will be conducted to compare the knowledge and perception about KMC services and referral for LBWI using KMC before and after the intervention.\n \n The primary outcome measure is improvements in LBWI outcomes such as survival, presence of complications, CFR, and cause of death after graduated from or receiving some KMC service. The secondary outcome measures include improvements in knowledge, opinion, and perception of health personnel about KMC and LBWI referral using KMC. To monitor implementation, several tools will be developed such as KMC admission criteria both in hospital and in the community setting.\n \n The USG-Supported partner has extensive experience in the interventions to improve perinatal and neonatal survival in developing countries. Therefore, through this collaboration the research team will gain experience in conducting quality research in newborn care and publishing in the international journals.",

This project will leverage an existing Indonesian-U.S. collaboration to make advances in marine microorganism biology, stimulate chemistry discoveries, and engage in outreach to STEM students. The focus will be on using biodiverse Indonesian sponges as a source of new halotolerant Gram-negative bacteria. The project will be based at Diponegoro University (UNDIP, Indonesia) and will be led by Prof. Radjasa, working in cooperation with the natural products lab team of Prof. Crews and leveraging his National Institutes of Health-sponsored project “Merging Marine-Derived Natural Products With Experimental Therapeutics.” The goals are (1) to leverage the aims and expertise of the Crews group to forge a marine sponge-inspired initiative with the Radjasa group at UNDIP; (2) to isolate, characterize, and culture at least 30 strains of Gram-negative bacteria from Indonesian marine sponges; (3) to discover at least 10 novel secondary metabolite scaffolds through the culturing of chemically prolific microorganism strains; (4) to establish a productive research partnership between scientists at UNDIP and UCSC through exchange visits; and (5) to play a part in USAID/Indonesia higher education objectives by providing undergraduate training for at least five UNDIP students using STEM programs in place at UCSC, training on marine biotechnology for four undergradute students, and curriculum development.\n \n The exploitation of symbiotic bacteria as a source for novel secondary metabolites is considered to be in its infancy; however, the discovery rate of novel active metabolites from marine Gram-negative bacteria could surpass that of their terrestrial counterparts. Sponges represent an unusual niche for novel microbes, as they host hundreds of different bacterial groups and contain diverse symbionts. However, the marine environments in which they are found still remain largely unexplored, understudied, and underexploited. The urgent need for novel substances for the treatment of severe human diseases combined with the recognition that marine organisms provide a rich potential source of such substances support the intensive exploration of new substances from marine organisms. This project will use organisms and methods to overcome existing bottlenecks by using halotolerant Gram-negative bacteria, which can be grown in large scale in the laboratory and which are potent producers of bioactive compounds.",

    "name": "PEER - Implementing a combination of rapid diagnostic tests, biomarkers and standard of care procedures for the diagnosis of pneumonia in pediatric patients to improve clinical management in Indonesia\n PEER5-408",
    "description": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children below five years of age. While advances have been made in the management of childhood pneumonia, gaps remain that may hinder efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality. These gaps include the absence of a universally accepted diagnostic gold standard for childhood pneumonia, especially one that can also differentiate between bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonia. This study will evaluate the use of an algorithm utilizing several rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), biomarkers, and standard of care (SOC) procedures in differentiating these different pathogens in pediatric patients admitted to Tangerang and Kariadi hospitals in Indonesia. Secondary objectives of the study include (1) identifying the etiologies of pneumonia in children in Indonesia; (2) documenting outcomes; (3) evaluating the use of each RDT (influenza, RSV, Pneumococcus), biomarkers (CRP, PCT), and SOC in distinguishing viral and bacterial pathogens; and (4) providing updated strains of circulating viruses, bacteria, and antibiotic resistance. \n \n The results of this study will impact case management in children with pneumonia, from accurate diagnosis to appropriate treatment and development of prevention strategies. Subsequently, they should contribute significantly to the reduction of childhood morbidity and mortality in Indonesia. The proposed clinical pathway can inform management policies at the hospitals and highlight potential etiologies and diagnostics that should be considered by clinicians, microbiologists, and clinical pathologists. This clinical pathway may also change the policies of the national insurance company by informing decisions on the diagnostic testing that is covered under the program currently and improving the cost-benefit ratio. Improved diagnostics and treatments can enable earlier commencement of appropriate treatment and decreased hospitalization time. The identification of influenza or other viruses as the causes of pneumonia can help to change the current perceptions of clinicians and health policy makers regarding the ability of these viruses to cause severe illness and improve provision of antivirals. As the awareness will be enhanced and new policies may be applied, the private sector (e.g., pharmaceutical companies and diagnostic test manufacturers) may be motivated to improve the performance of their products with regard to efficacy, sensitivity, and specificity. The team's research may also have an impact on enhancing surveillance for pathogens, especially influenza H5N1, that may cause a pandemic threat. Improved information regarding the pathogens causing pneumonia will help to identify and highlight research priorities in pediatric pneumonia and also enable health programs to develop improved control and prevention measures at the community level.",

    "name": "PEER - Improving hospital care for breastfeeding support in Indonesia PEER H2-002",
    "description": "Breastfeeding, especially exclusive breastfeeding, is one of the most effective preventive health measures available to reduce infant morbidity and mortality. For all newborns, but especially for the sick ones, breastfeeding is a simple life saving method. To improve worldwide breastfeeding initiation and duration rates, the WHO and UNICEF launched the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) in 1991. The BFHI consists of the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. The BFHI is currently the gold standard for evidence-based breastfeeding care in hospitals. Data continues to accumulate showing that adherence to the Ten Steps predict breastfeeding duration and exclusivity long after hospital discharge. However, despite the strong evidence for the Ten Steps, hospital compliance in Indonesia is poor. A national survey for hospitals in Indonesia in 2011 found only 8% of state hospital complying with 7 out of 10 steps of successful breastfeeding.\n \n In order to improve hospital care for breastfeeding we need to identify the barriers and opportunities of BFHI Implementation in Indonesia and obtain solid local evidence on implementing of BFHI by performing a pilot project. Thus, this project will consist of 2 studies. Study 1 is a qualitative study exploring the barriers and facilitators of BFHI implementation in Indonesia. This study will cover various stakeholders related to hospital support for breastfeeding in Indonesia from all levels: Ministry of Health, Provincial and district health offices, related professional organization, several selected hospitals, and community mother support groups. Three provinces that will be involved are Jakarta, West Java, and Banten. One district will be selected for each province and three hospitals will be selected in the respective district. Study 2 is a quasi-experimental study which will be conducted in Banten Province involving 6 hospitals with different types of services and ownership that will be randomly allocated to intervention and control groups - 3 hospitals for each group. The intervention is WHO BFHI section 2 (training for hospital managers), WHO BFHI section 3 (training for maternity staff), and 12 months technical assistance performed by Indonesian Breastfeeding Center. The outcomes of this study are the performance of hospitals on BFHI implementation using WHO module, breastfeeding self efficacy scale, family breastfeeding support scale, LATCH score, and breastfeeding rates. These outcomes will be measured both for healthy and sick newborn.",

    "description": "Research has not yet identified all the impacts of climate changes on island nations like Indonesia. One of the challenges is the complexity of the available data in Indonesia. This project is aimed at combining two sets of processes—climate change-induced sea level rise and coastal hazards (coastal erosion, tsunami, and coastal flooding)—using three projected periods (30, 50, and 100 years). Climate change-induced sea level rise coupled with coastal hazards is a rarely studied topic in Indonesia. Dr. Syamsidik and his team expect that the project should produce newly developed scenarios for assessing impacts of climate change-induced sea level rise in Indonesia’s coastal cities, combining information on sea level rise (a slow process) and coastal hazards (a relatively fast process). Their work will also incorporate scientifically based policy analysis of urban development planning in order to increase the preparedness of cities in the region. In addition, this research will compare the projected impacts of sea level rise coupled with coastal hazards between two coastal cities representing the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere of Indonesia. The impact comparisons will highlight variations resulting from geographical differences. This research will also offer examples for incorporating scientific evidence on climate change and coastal hazard impacts with techno-social approaches for disaster mitigation and climate change adaptation.\n \n U.S. partner Dr. Comfort will assist this research team with her expertise in analyzing development planning policies. Her techno-social approach will a valuable resource for the Indonesian team. To gather input and disseminate their findings, Dr. Syamsidik and his colleagues will organize several forums for stakeholders from the national and local levels. Two policy briefings will be made to address the issue of climate change impacts and their incorporation into development planning for coastal cities in Indonesia. This research team will also produce inputs for improving university-level instruction in courses involving climate change and disaster management. Lessons learned from this research process will be used in revising the relevant course curricula at Syiah Kuala University in Banda Aceh and Mataram University in Mataram.",

    "name": "PEER - Integrating ISLE in Integrated Science Instruction to Improve Science Teacher's Abilities on STEM Education\n PEER 6-052",
    "description": "Since the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) was first administered, Indonesia has consistently performed poorly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). In 2015, Indonesia was ranked 63rd for mathematics and 62nd for science out of 70 countries. Current results of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) also show that the abilities of Indonesian students to apply and reason in science and math are below average. One reason could be that common teaching practices in Indonesia rarely promote critical thinking skills. Therefore, improvement is needed in teacher content knowledge and skills in STEM education. Responding to this challenge, in late 2013 Indonesia launched a new curriculum promoting critical thinking, called “curriculum 2013” or K-13. K-13 introduces the scientific approach as a teaching methodology following five stages: observing, questioning, experimenting, rationalizing, and communicating. The Indonesian government has invested a great deal in training teachers in K-13, but many problems have been encountered in implementation, as the teachers were not ready and lacked sufficient pedagogical content knowledge to integrate the scientific approach into their instruction.\n \n Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE), an approach developed by U.S. partner Dr. Eugenia Etkina of Rutgers University, improves students’ scientific abilities by bringing actual science practice into the classroom. In ISLE students learn by observing real phenomena, analyzing patterns, devising explanations, and testing them experimentally (Etkina, 2015). Inspired by taking an ISLE training workshop from Dr. Etkina in 2015, the PI Dr. Irwandi and his team will use their PEER support to develop ISLE-based integrated science instruction to improve teachers’ abilities in STEM education. In the initial phase, they will apply ISLE instruction in integrated science courses at the secondary school level in Indonesia, and later they will apply it in the lab instruction component of a university-level basic physics course.",

    "description": "The underachievement of Indonesian science education reform efforts and the continued problem of Indonesian low scores on international assessments of science education at the pre-university level are matters of serious concern. Not only do these problems have implications for the future of Indonesia’s workforce, their continued neglect could affect the future of Indonesia’s democracy and international stability. Among the lowest scoring of the Indonesian student populations are those who graduate from the country’s religious schools, currently 20% of the student population. The study draws on best practices in science education and links them with professional development practices that are tied to curriculum units that will actually be used in classrooms. The objectives of the project are to (1) determine and describe how science is taught in Indonesian Islamic schools and propose an curriculum intervention that is aligned with the national curriculum; (2) apply the intervention in the classroom and describe and analyze its implementation; and (3) compare the intervention with control groups and report the findings. The work will involve significant partnerships with leading universities in three key cities in Java: Yogyakarta, Malang, and Surabaya. Enhancing the capacity of the Indonesian educational research community to describe and evaluate its own educational system is an important benefit of the proposed research. \n \n This research will produce a model for the treatment in science education in religious schools. A key feature of the treatment program is to develop a learning method that integrates religious motivation with motivation to learn science. The results of this research will be disseminated to stakeholders of educational providers in Indonesia, especially operators of religious schools, to be adopted and developed in the context of each. The largest operators of religious schools in Indonesia are NU and Muhammadiyah, two major Muslim organizations in this country. Mr. Askuri and his team will establish cooperation with these two organizations to implement the science education curriculum integrating the religious approach as a result of this project. Furthermore, the organizations will be encouraged to develop this new approach further in their individual contexts. This project will also train dozens of researchers from various universities in Indonesia and build their capacity through workshops and interdisciplinary collaborative research. In addition, this program will also train dozens of science teachers in the latest scientific learning methods. One output of the project will be teaching materials that can be used by teachers for classroom instruction and by students for independent study. This teaching material will be created in open-source digital format, so it can be replicated broadly by other schools that are not included in the project.",

    "name": "PEER - Strengthening Resilience to Extreme Weather Related Events in Indonesia through improving the predictability of drought risk within Drought Cycle Management Model\n PEER5-125",
    "description": "This project focuses on drought as one of the major natural hazards in Indonesia. The primary aim is to improve the predictability of drought events as part of disaster risk reduction within the framework of the Drought Cycle Management (DCM) model. The DCM has proven to be a robust and practical approach for drought management in Africa for more than 30 years, but it has never been implemented in Indonesia. Differences in drought characteristics and community profiles between Indonesia and Africa will introduce interesting challenges for formulating novel strategies towards DCM implementation. One of the challenges will be how to predict future drought events under Indonesia’s unique tropical climate variability. This project will develop a Drought Monitoring and Forecasting System (DMFS) and formulate scenarios to reduce drought risk, based on approaches previously applied by U.S. partner Dr. Sheffield and colleagues. The DMFS will be developed by drawing from methods developed by the Terrestrial Hydrology Group of Princeton University, integrated with seasonal drought forecasting derived from downscaled climate forecasts from the North America Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME)-II for predicting drought events in Indonesia. \n \n Specifically, the goals of the project are (1) to improve the predictability of drought by developing a reliable monitoring and forecasting system; (2) to formulate a best framework for implementing a DCM model in Indonesia that incorporates local drought characteristics and community profiles; and (3) to test the effectiveness of the DCM model to reduce drought risk. To answer these questions, Dr. Kuswanto and his team will collect historical climate and hydrology data to characterize drought and use this to develop a drought prediction model based on climate prediction and statistical models. The two most vulnerable districts have been identified as the site for the pilot study for implementation of DCM: Probolinggo, East Java, and Lombok Utara, Nusa Tenggara Barat. They are listed as top priority districts due to their vulnerability to drought impacts. Based on participatory evaluations conducted on these two districts, statistical evidence will be evaluated to confirm the effectiveness of DCM. The U.S. collaborators will assist with the development of the DMFS for Indonesia, as well as with DCM implementation in the targeted districts. They will also provide remote sensing data required to build the system.\n \n The Government of Indonesia (GoI) has made climate change mitigation and adaptation a national priority. Climate change resilience has been the focus of the GoI as part of the commitment to implementing the Sendai Framework for the Disaster Risk Reduction Framework. Climate change resilience has also become one of the focuses of the USAID mission in Indonesia. This PEER project supports these interests by focusing on a parallel strategy to strengthen extreme weather and climate resilience. The Meteorological Office Indonesia (BMKG) issues drought information from a simple monitoring system but with very low predictive capacity and hence drought forecasts have never been made properly. Moreover, the provided drought information is difficult for smallholders and communities to access directly, which has led to lack of actions to reduce the risk. Therefore, the DMFS coupled with an effective strategy for easy access to information by communities/smallholders, is urgently required. The DCM will frame how decisions are currently made at the smallholder and community levels in response to drought and determine whether decisions can be made (based on forecast information) to reduce drought risk. The project will ensure that communities and smallholders will have access to the drought information generated from the system, which is consistent with the idea of the DCM model.",

    "description": "Science education at the K-12 levels in Bengkulu does not focus on biodiversity. Fieldwork is rarely included as an instructional technique at any educational level, and there is little focus on local conservation issues. Bengkulu University (Unib) recently started a graduate program for teachers with the theme of “Natural Conservation Education for A Better Life.” In conjunction with this graduate program, Unib has also started a pioneering conservation effort, \"Unib Campus, A Safe Home for Turtles,” with educational components at the K-12 level and at the university as part of the Science Teacher Education curriculum track. Meanwhile the U.S. Government-supported partner from North Carolina has engaged equal numbers of high school students, girls and boys, with a focus on rural minority students, in summer residential programs that teach the students about herpetology by involving them in research on native species. Teachers are included as participants in the summer programs and graduate students are able to earn university credit by participating. The main goal of this PEER project is to develop both science and learning research capacity through cooperation between UNC Greensboro and Unib using the field of herpetology as a venue to improve conservation education and, indeed, conservation itself. Furthermore the cooperation is designed to achieve the following goals; (1) identify some safe habitats for five species of turtles, (2) increase science and learning research capacity through the thesis research of nine graduate students, (3) develop teaching modules, (4) develop both indoor and outdoor learning resources, and (5) establish a new teacher training center in herpetology and environmental education on the green campus of Unib.\n \n This project will support the spirit of the program “Unib Campus, A Safe Home for Turtles,” which is a novelty for Indonesia. The existence of the turtles on the Unib campus will be a learning resource for conservation education for the young people in Bengkulu. This model of conservation efforts through educational approaches is designed to be completed over three years, as an attempt to improve the competence of biology teachers in Bengkulu and other provinces of Indonesia. This project will change some paradigms of science education so as to approach the criteria of “teaching green,” among others. It will foster a personal connection with nature, connections with other people and other species, and help participants move from awareness to knowledge to action. Furthermore, it will help move science education in Bengkulu from a very formal model to a more culturally appropriate effort for increasing young peoples’ knowledge, appreciation, attitudes, environmental awareness, and involvement in nature conservation in Bengkulu. There is a clear distinction between scientists and science teachers in Indonesian universities, with scientists focusing on pure biology (science) and science teachers focusing on learning biology (pedagogy). Some educational institutions in Indonesia still emphasize this dichotomy between content and learning, which has been noted as a classical problem in science education. This project will develop both science and learning research capacity to show that these two identities can co-exist in a single individual and that this can be very beneficial.",

    "description": "This research project will document and catalog patterns of biodiversity in the aquatic environments of Southern Iraq and enable scientists at the University of Basrah Marine Science Centre (UBMSC) to adopt new tools for forecasting the effects of extremely rapid environmental change on the region’s biodiversity. The project stems from a partnership established between the UBMSC and Northeastern University’s Marine Science Center (NUMSC), which was formalized as a Memorandum of Understanding between the two institutions. With the help of the U.S. State Department’s Iraq Education desk and the Consulate General in Basra, NUMSC scientists have shipped water monitoring sensors and lab equipment to UB faculty, and have developed online training modules. To date this project has received no funding other than a small amount of support from Northeastern University.\n \n Building on this partnership, this PEER-supported effort has four primary goals: (1) creation of methods for surveying patterns of aquatic diversity in Southern Iraq; (2) collection of genetic samples that will be cataloged with the Ocean Genome Legacy, based at the NUMSC (3) training of Iraqi scientists through short courses offered at the NUMSC in Boston; and (4) training in modern physiological methods for measuring environmental stress in culturally, economically, and ecologically important aquatic species. The project will further facilitate collaborative research by incorporating its results into the Group on Earth Observations (GEO-BON).\n \n This proposal explicitly addresses three challenges related to shrinking water reserves in Iraq: (1) response to environmental changes; (2) restoration of threatened biodiversity; and (3) proliferation of invasive aquatic plants. The first phase of the project will be to catalog and map patterns of biodiversity and, by making comparisons against baselines obtained from the literature, to detect any major changes in the aquatic ecosystems. It is noteworthy that much of this information on historic biodiversity is contained in manuscripts in the UB library, so one outcome of this project will be to digitize and translate these manuscripts to facilitate their preservation and dissemination. The project will further involve the collection of genetic samples to be sequenced and stored at the Ocean Genome Legacy. OGL is a “Noah’s Ark” of genetic information, not only is a warehouse for genetic material for threatened and endangered marine species but also a means of freely sharing those genetic materials with the scientific community. The second phase of the project will build on established methods for forecasting the effects of environmental change on biodiversity (the expertise of the NU faculty) to predict which species are at greatest risk. Using a combination of environmental information from field-deployed sensors and satellites, with experimental measurements of physiological tolerances of key marine organisms, it is possible to predict which species are most under threat of extinction to rapid environmental change. The project is expected to have direct practical consequences for the preservation of aquatic biodiversity in Iraq, as UB faculty have been approached by the Iraqi Prime Minster and the Ministry of Health and the Environment to help develop a biodiversity plan after the designation of the Basra Marshes as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",

    "description": "This project is focused on the study of the functions of nanofiber membranes and their use to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions. In the short term, the researchers will study electrospinning parameters in order to design nanofibers from available waste materials in Kurdistan Region. Long-term goals include broadening the technology of electrospinning nanofiber membranes as an option to conventional membranes and polymer beads. The electrospun membrane, in particular, may be successfully applied in water treatment and biotechnology, where the removal of toxic materials requires materials with a high surface area. In addition to the high surface area, changes in the surface chemistry of the nanofibers may also do wonders for their performance.\n \n Nanofiber technology has hugely impacted both science and engineering disciplines. The motivations for the miniaturization process of polymers are based on producing nano-sized fibers with superior properties (for example, excellent mechanical properties and a large surface area per unit mass) compared to microfiber and film. The functionalities of the polymers plus the unique characteristics of nanofibers originated from them and being engineered in various forms have allowed nanofibers to be used in advanced applications such as filtration, multifunctional membranes, composite reinforcement, tissue engineering scaffolds, drug delivery, and wound dressings. As for water purification, a very important application in water-scare areas such a Iraq, adsorption is a technique that can potentially achieve high yields of heavy metal removal even for low concentration effluents. It can be a more cost-effective process to remove and recover heavy metals, based on the choice of adsorbent material. This PEER award will support fundamental research into a new adsorbent prepared from waste polymers. It will be the first research project in nanotechnology carried out at the University of Duhok. By providing opportunities for several researchers to gain firsthand experience in nanotechnology research, the program will help to improve the research infrastructure and enhance research collaboration both within the department and with the U.S. partner.",

    "description": "Jordan is facing a future of very limited water resources, among the lowest in the world on a per capita basis. Water scarcity is the single most important natural constraint to the country’s economic growth and development. Therefore, wastewater reuse is increasingly viewed as the primary long-term strategy for conservation of limited freshwater resources. In Jordan, the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation has been practiced since the 1980s to overcome the severe water shortage. In 1998, the Ministry of Water and Irrigation commenced a wastewater management policy, stating that wastewater is a resource and cannot be treated as waste. More than 129 million cubic meters of wastewater is treated and reused for irrigation in agriculture activities, which are considered as one of the highest reuse rates among the Arab countries (95%). The treated wastewater is mixed with freshwater at the dams and then used for unrestricted irrigation in Jordan. Given these water reuse practices, the potential threats posed pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in treated wastewater to water resources and the food chain through plant uptake merit evaluation.\n \n The results of this project will provide a comprehensive overview of the occurrence and behavior of PPCPs in the Middle East and North Africa region. The research team will assess information on the impacts of wastewater irrigation on water quality and human health in the region and will establish a baseline on the level of pharmaceutical contamination in Jordan’s water supply, irrigation water specifically, and vegetables grown using it. Moreover, this project should also help the water authorities in Jordan and worldwide take effective measures to protect water resources (groundwater and surface water), protect public health from the impact of PPCPs, and facilitate the rational reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture. The partnership with the U.S. researcher will allow for capacity building of researchers at the Jordan Royal Scientific Society in conducting scientific research on the impacts of emerging pollutant accumulation in the aquatic environment. The project outcomes will be disseminated to appropriate stakeholders.",

    "description": "The overall objectives of this research are to develop (1) the KRB flood prediction models using NASA satellite observations that capture the magnitude, timing, and spatial distribution of watershed scale snowmelt parameters; and (2) combined surface and ground water modeling and prediction analyses. The project aims to develop the integrated surface and groundwater modeling for the transboundary (Pakistan upstream and Afghanistan downstream) Kabul River Basin (KRB) with satellite enhanced snowmelt flood and drought predictions. The researchers will apply advanced NASA satellite data to track snow, snow melting, floods, surface water coverage, and droughts over the KRB. They will adapt cost-effective approaches using remote sensing data, with expertise provided by the U.S. partner Dr. Jacobs, based on her experience working on the NASA-supported project \"Satellite Enhanced Snowmelt Flood Predictions in the Red River of the North Basin, USA.\" A lack of accurate snow depth and snow water equivalent data, and a lack of understanding of snowmelt processes and soil infiltration during soil freeze and thaw events in the KRB inhibit the ability to improve flood predictions. This project will improve the models by using satellite observations that capture the magnitude, timing, and spatial distribution of watershed-scale snowmelt parameters, as well as antecedent soil conditions. Most of the existing water-related research models were developed with separate components for the surface water and the groundwater, but this project will combine them into a more comprehensive model, which should facilitate better prediction analyses. \n \n Beyond the expected capacity building impacts for project participants and improved modeling technologies, the project should promote better regional transboundary water cooperation outside of high-level intergovernmental channels by providing a platform for interactions among academia and community-level water management structures from Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and the United States. University-led forums will be organized to promote improved sustainable management of shared water resources within the context of climate change in Central and South Asia.

    "name": "PEER - DNA Barcoding to Combat Wildlife Crime\n PEER4-365",
    "description": "Wildlife criminals, poachers, and traffickers of endangered species protected under CITES and national laws are developing new ways to avoid detection and prosecution. In the case of protected animals, traffickers are shipping them as butchered and processed meat, eggs or juvenile stages, dried powders, and other forms that have proven difficult to identify. In these forms, even taxonomic experts cannot provide species identifications based on morphology because diagnostic characteristics (commonly provided by bones and hides) are absent from confiscated material. As a result, border inspectors, police, and park rangers may not suspect that intercepted objects come from protected species. Even in cases where suspicions are aroused and the materials are confiscated, crime investigators aren’t able to identify them with confidence. The same may prove true even for the expert zoologists who receive the objects for identification. In those rare cases when an expert provides an identification using the few morphological features preserved, it is difficult to overcome the objections of defense attorneys who raise doubts in the minds of magistrates.\n \n This project proposes to use “DNA barcode” sequence data to identify confiscated materials by their species of origin. DNA barcoding has become an accepted and commonly used method for species identification practiced by taxonomists, ecologists and other academic researchers. Since 2012, Kenya has been one of six partner countries in the Google-supported Barcode of Wildlife Project (BWP), which has provided training to staff at the National Museums of Kenya and the Kenya Wildlife Service. These institutions are assembling a reference library of DNA barcodes from endangered species that can be used to identify confiscated material. The Kenyan researchers continue to receive technical support and advanced training from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, the U.S. Government-supported partner on this project.\n \n The two main objectives of the project are to expand training and technical assistance to new participants in Tanzania, as well as strengthen Kenya’s systemic response to poaching in two ways. First, DNA-based research on endangered species through the National Museums of Kenya will create new tools for prosecuting wildlife criminals. Second, collaboration with the Kenya Wildlife Service will put these tools to work in Kenyan courtrooms. The result should be a rapid near-term rise in the rate of convictions for poaching and trafficking, followed by long-term growth in the population sizes of endangered species and measures of ecosystem health. These should translate into prosperity in agriculture, greater food security, job creation, and a strong and sustainable tourism industry.",

    "description": "Illegal bushmeat trade is a global impediment to biodiversity conservation and public health. In Kenya and Tanzania, bushmeat trade has escalated to unsustainable levels, presenting a major threat to East African wildlife populations. Bushmeat trade and consumption expose humans and livestock to diseases such as Ebola and retroviruses, and bushmeat hunters risk contracting diseases from ticks and tsetse flies. Prosecution of bushmeat trade perpetrators in East Africa requires forensic evidence based on cytochrome oxidase I (COI) DNA-barcode sequencing, which is costly and time-consuming. There is a need for rapid, cost-effective forensic tools to screen for wildlife DNA in meat samples to support surveillance of bushmeat trade and improve law enforcement against perpetrators.\n \n Effective prosecution against illegal bushmeat trade in Kenya and Tanzania is hampered by lack of cheap scientific methods and trained personnel to undertake high-throughput screening of suspect samples. The proposed research will develop cost-effective high resolution melting analysis (HRMA)-based bushmeat identification and build the capacity for its implementation by wildlife agencies in Kenya and Tanzania. The protocols will enhance transboundary surveillance systems by accelerating identification of wildlife barcodes in samples, which can then be sequenced to provide forensic proof for prosecution. Adoption of this method by the wildlife agencies will generate crucial data on the extent of illegal bushmeat trade in the region, thereby providing a basis for review and harmonization of national and cross-border policies, laws and penalties against illegal bushmeat trade.",

    "description": "DNA tools are becoming increasingly useful for investigating and prosecuting wildlife crimes, including matching carcasses to biological products being smuggled and determining the location of poaching hotspots from which large quantities of biological material were derived. Elephant-specific microsatellites have been developed and accurately used to map elephant populations over the entire African continent using DNA derived from their feces (Wasser et al., 2004). The map is currently being used to trace illegal ivory shipments back to their origin using DNA extracted from seized ivory (Wasser et al., 2004). Elephant poaching within East Africa has progressively increased since 2006 (Underwood et al., 2013) with the greatest concentration of large ivory seizures coming from East Africa and especially southern Tanzania. Since 2013, the number of large ivory seizures made in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania has grown to levels beyond those made in Asia. Timely identification of the origins of these seizures is vital, both for timely prosecutions but also to provide time-sensitive intelligence on major shifts in poaching activities across East Africa. This project aims to build a collaborative forensic network between Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda by enhancing the forensic capabilities of newly formed wildlife DNA labs in both Kenya and Tanzania, where the largest elephant populations reside in East Africa and considerable cross-border movement of elephants occur.\n \n A major part of this effort also involves enhancing coverage of the existing continent-wide elephant DNA database (Wasser et al., 2004) by sampling and genotyping elephant dung in all important elephant areas within the region where samples are still lacking. Enhancing this comprehensive elephant DNA database for East Africa will greatly increase the capacities of authorities to monitor changes in areas of concentrated poaching as well as bring cases to successful prosecution in a timely basis. The U.S. Government-supported partner will contribute all existing genotypes from these areas to this effort and use these collections to enhance this continent-wide microsatellite DNA map used to assign origin to large ivory seizures made throughout the world.\n \n Planned capacity building activities under the project include proficiency testing and validation using the laboratory of the Smithsonian-based partner. Other components of this training will include proper sampling protocols for large seizures, as well as training of rangers and lab technicians across East Africa on how to maintain chain of custody throughout sample collection and analyses, including use of tamper proof containers, pre-printed barcode labels, and proper documentation of a full audit trail of the sampling process. The most important product of this initiative will be to increase effectiveness of tools to monitor and police the illegal killing of elephants within East Africa and enhance local capacity to produce credible evidence for prosecution of illegal ivory traffickers. The genetic database established for East African elephants will be used to enhance the detection and validation of poaching hot spots within the region and link seized products to their original crime scene to enhance prosecution of ivory traffickers in a court of law.",

    "description": "Laikipia County in central Kenya supports one of the highest levels of mammalian diversity in East Africa. The semi-arid environment is changing rapidly due to land use changes, and climatic changes are projected to alter ecosystem resilience. These anthropogenic changes can alter the dynamics of zoonotic infectious diseases in wooded and bushland fringes of semi-arid ecosystems. Vector-borne diseases carried by vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, and sand flies are known for their rapid response to environmental modifications and climate change. In this project, the team will focus on the interrelationships between climate change, land use patterns and their impacts on large mammal distribution, and disease vector diversity. They will also study how these in turn influence human adaptation and ecosystem resilience to ecological change. Specifically, they will use the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to examine the relationship between inter-annual NDVI parameters and species richness of large mammals and ticks and sand flies as disease vectors. They will also examine primary productivity of current land use systems within current climate patterns and its relationship to mammals and vegetation cover. Lastly, they will examine variation in host feeding preferences of zoophilic mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks from different land use systems and climatic zones of Laikipia. \n \n The use of remote sensed data to represent environmental factors influencing species richness in different ecosystems in Laikipia will provide valuable knowledge on the spatial variability of species richness and ecological resilience of different land use systems.

The first will be a new knowledge base of the legal and illegal markets for plants in Kenya and Tanzania. Official records, new market surveys, and genetic analyses of plants being sold in domestic markets and trafficked across national borders will be compiled to provide a more accurate picture of the uses and over-uses of plant species. This knowledge base will be used to help enforcement agencies improve their efforts to stop poaching and illegal trafficking of endangered species; identify areas where wild plants are being illegally harvested for sale; identify potential markets for valuable cultivated plants for legal sale; and create new community-based sustainable strategies to restore and protect ecosystem services that are threatened by illegal harvesting of wild plants. The second knowledge source produced by the project will be a public reference library of DNA barcodes—short standardized DNA sequences that enable enforcement officials to identify plants that are difficult to assign to their correct species using traditional morphological features such as flowers. This component of the project builds on the success of the Barcode of Wildlife Project, led by the Smithsonian and funded by Google, in which Kenya has been a partner country. Kenya will use its demonstrated ability to generate high-quality DNA barcode records to expand the reference library to include more plant species that are endangered and protected by CITES and national law, as well as non-protected species with potential economic importance to Kenya and Tanzania. \n \n \n Kenya and Tanzania have great natural wealth in the form of exotic animals and plants in and outside protected areas that attract ecotourists, but these resources can generate significant additional wealth if used in new ways. Bushmeat hunting and the illegal gathering of plants from the wild are being conducted as extractive industries, not sustainable enterprises. Yet thousands of plant species are valued as herbal medicines and ingredients in skin care products, ornamentals for landscapes, and as cut flowers, sacramental elements in traditional and religious ceremonies, and for other uses. Illegal harvesting and over-exploitation is reducing the economic benefits and development opportunities that Kenya and Tanzania can obtain from their rich biodiversity. This project seeks to change the balance with new knowledge-based policies and activities. The proposed knowledgebase of legal and illegal plant trade will be used to help identify species, populations, and ecosystems at risk from over-harvesting and suggest plant species that could be domesticated and marketed to improve livelihoods. Project results could also support new policies for community-based ecosystem development projects leading to increased ecotourism and farming, promote biodiversity conservation, and raise awareness among the public and government officials regarding plant poaching and its cost to national economies.",

    "description": "Afghanistan has highlighted the need for improved water resource management as an essential first step towards rebuilding rural communities and improved human health. Food security in Central Asia and Afghanistan also represents a major and worsening problem. The agricultural sector will be an important focus for upgrading human capital skills, given the size of the rural population. The aim of this research project is to lift Afghanistan out of the identified knowledge gap on its water resources and remove existing barriers to sustainable integrated water resource development and management (IWRM) in the Amu Darya Basin, as well as promoting strategic environmental assessment. At the same time, the project is expected to provide transparency on the potential impact of integrated water resource development plans and ongoing projects to downstream riparian states, as well as the donor community. Because of its international position, American University of Central Asia will take the lead in data generation and analysis and will collaborate with research and implementing agencies in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. In many ways, the Kyrgyz Republic is ahead of its neighbors on issues associated with the effective use of water resources, and through successful implementation of this project the country could serve as a positive example for the region. Providing qualified training of local communities and universities on IWRM in the project area is critical in advancing future research. \n \n Within the Amu Darya Basin, about 30 million people depend on irrigated agriculture for their livelihoods. Past wars and civil conflicts have hindered the upstream riparian state Afghanistan from developing its agricultural sector. The current focus of the international community on facilitating sustainable development and poverty reduction in Afghanistan is likely to increase water utilization within its transboundary basins and therefore might have a negative effect on livelihoods in downstream riparian states. Like many regions across the world, Central Asia and Afghanistan are seeking ways to make the best use of limited water resources. The purpose of this research project is to close the knowledge gap on water resources and potential irrigated areas within three sub-basins of the Amu Darya Basin within Afghanistan, as well as to help determine the legal obligations of Afghanistan to its riparian neighbors. The closure of this gap should help Afghanistan and the donor community to plan their sustainable water development and environmental assessment strategies and projects. The project research team will assemble a data set on water availability, changes in irrigated areas, and the irrigation potential in the three target sub-basins. They will also develop a model of impacts of ongoing rehabilitation projects in Afghanistan on lower provinces within the tributary basins, as well as riparian states within the Amu Darya Basin. They aim to provide an array of cost-effective tools to agricultural producers in the three sub-basins of the Amu Darya River Basin to assist them with optimizing irrigation scheduling and maximizing crop yields with the water available each year. In addition, they will provide new tools for quantifying and forecasting irrigation demand to water managers in order to help schedule water deliveries to growers effectively.",

    "description": "Water is both a crucial limiting resource and a central unifying element in coupled human-natural systems, particularly in arid regions. The rivers of Central Asia originate in high mountains that support an syncretistic civilization and vibrant ecosystems, as well as agricultural and economic activity of increasing regional and global importance. The water resources system in Central Asia is under stress due to multiple interrelated drivers of change. The water supply from seasonal snow and glacial melt is and will be impacted by climate change, and water demands will continue to increase with population growth and land use change. This project will deliver important information about long-term climate and glacier-water resources changes in a major transboundary river basin of Central Asia, specifically the Amu Darya River basin and its tributarities in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. New advanced data on Central Asia deglaciation during the Holocene based on the glacial moraine physical stratigraphy and isotope-chemistry analyses (14С, 234U/238U, 16О/18О) are critical, particularly for the poorly studied transboundary river basins, to understand the past and possible future scenarios of deglaciation and water resources change under global and regional climate change impacts. The new data to be obtained in the project will enrich the research program being carried out by the U.S. Government-supported partner and colleagues in their project on spatial-temporal changes in climate and glacier water resources in Central Asia. By comparing the data to be collected in this project with existing paleoclimate records from ice cores in the Altai, Tien Shan, Pamir, Kunlun, Tibet, and the Himalayas, the researchers will gain better understanding of Asian climate variability during the Holocene. This will reveal the dynamics in space and time of major historical climatic events and periods that have occurred in Asia. Understanding the mechanisms and rate of past climate and glacier variability in Asia is crucial to developing new methods for glacier-water resources prediction, vulnerability metrics, and adaptation strategies. \n \n Specific project tasks include analyzing meteorological and hydrological data sets from the last 50-100 years and integrating them with new data on paleoclimate and deglaciation to elucidate water resource variability within the transboundary river basins. Analysis of the modern and Holocene time set data will help predict possible water resource changes in the future and evaluate adaptation options that respond to environment requirements, agricultural and urban demands, ecosystem services, and flood management. The gaps in hydrological measurements and total absence of data following the disintegration of the USSR will be complimented by new research data obtained during the project. The results of the project should help officials in the region take timely measures to adapt to climate change, alleviate its effects, and relieve the international stress caused by the growing deficit of water resources.",

    "name": "PEER - Enhancing Water Quality Monitoring and Improving Water Disinfection Processes in Lebanon.\n PEER5-018",
    "description": "Relative to its neighbors, Lebanon has often been considered as a water-rich country. Unfortunately, the combined effects of climate change, population growth, and infrastructure underinvestment are creating considerable water stress in Lebanese cities. Specifically, an extended drought coupled with increased water demands from the arrival of large numbers of Syrian refugees is increasing the potential for water supply problems and degradation of water quality. International support for capacity building came first from USAID, which funded three municipal wastewater treatment plants to serve the population in the Beqaa and rehabilitated the main water establishments in the country by improving existing infrastructures. These efforts improved water quality, but there are still significant unmet needs. Development of existing but underdeveloped and new water resources would require consideration of the potential impacts of water pollution due to chemical contaminants and infectious disease pathogens. Currently, a lack of inexpensive water quality monitoring tools and the absence of advanced treatment technologies for industrial waste, hospital effluents, solid waste leachates, and municipal wastewater limit Lebanon’s ability to respond to challenges posed by water pollution. \n \n This project will improve water technologies and expand local capacity to monitor organic contaminants (OCs) and eradicate pathogenic bacteria in drinking water supplies. Previously, the research team received a PEER Cycle 1 award to investigate the use of activated persulfate (PS) to degrade trace concentrations of OCs in wastewater and water supplies. Dr. Ghauch and his colleagues also developed a room temperature phosphorimeter (RTP) capable of detecting special dyes used for verifying the authenticity of official papers such as banknotes. The first generation RTP was used for this application because it lacked the sensitivity needed to detect low concentrations of chemicals with low phosphorescence yields. In this new PEER Cycle 5 project, the team will now develop an innovative instrument to detect trace amounts of OCs in water by using a solid surface to pre-concentrate the OCs. Research will be conducted to identify materials that can be functionalized to improve the phosphorescence yield of the deposited OCs. After its accuracy and precision are verified, this new instrument will be used to assess the performance of different types of water treatment systems. It will also be used to monitor some OCs in Lebanese waterways that pose potential health risks (for example, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produced by cars and solid waste incineration). Technologies to be investigated include PS chemical and thermal activation methods and solar-based photolysis, with and without added oxidants. This approach can be used to degrade OCs while simultaneously inactivating bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens responsible for infectious diseases in contaminated drinking water. Experience obtained from studies with the new apparatus and different types of treatment systems will be used to develop a miniaturized prototype of the RTP, with the main goal of creating an inexpensive, robust sensor for monitoring trace OCs and the performance of water treatment systems. These objectives, once accomplished, should have important societal impacts by helping to decrease the toxicity of industrial effluents and sewage that are contaminating drinking water supplies and increasing the likelihood that infectious diseases will be spread. The team's results should also provide analytical and technical support to the nation’s water systems and help to involve stakeholders in efforts to improve water quality and the sustainability of drinking water availability.",

Cancer and respiratory, skin, and other diseases are occurring at an increasing rate in that area, which cover more than ten villages. The research team will evaluate the number of Syrians refugees and Lebanese inhabitants living near the dump who develop diseases. Water from this dump leaks into a canal that irrigates a large agricultural area. Identification of these pollutants, both chemical and microbiological, should contribute to finding a solution to protect the people living in the area. Using various advanced analytical chemistry techniques, the researchers will identify the toxic metals and cancer-inducing chemicals deposited into the dump by factories. Microbiological techniques will be used to identify the types of microorganisms growing in the dump. Clinical and biochemical techniques will be used to analyze the extent of health damage suffered by people living near the dump.\n \n During this two-year project, the research will document environmental and health impacts of the dump and then will aim to find a solution in order to eliminate the health-damaging effects on local residents. This project will link university students, many of them female, to social problems, especially in rural regions. Working as part of the study team, the students will engage with rural inhabitants and encourage active participation in decisions related to the safety of their municipalities. Seminars and workshops targeting school students and mothers will be organized to provide information on safety precautions. By identifying the main pollutants, the research team will help the waste companies involved to eliminate these wastes and take proper handling actions.

    "description": "Nepal, a small, landlocked country in the Himalayan region, boasts an astonishing variety of floral and faunal species due to the diversity of its topography and habitat types. Nepal’s biodiversity is declining due to anthropological stressors, including rapid growth in human population and settlements and human-wildlife conflict; however, the greatest risk to Nepal’s biodiversity lies in a lack of spatially and temporally-sensitive data that reflect potential future changes in habitat composition and distribution due to climate change. Barriers to collecting, analyzing, and sharing information have led to uninformed development, impacting livelihoods. \n \n This PEER project aims to fill existing and future gaps in knowledge supporting the developmental phase of JaibikMap, an interactive, open data, free web-based mapping tool that contains detailed data for addressing conservation and development challenges. The tool will be built on a scalable platform to accommodate additional data layers in the future. Addressing research gaps, project partners will conduct a nationwide study of forest change under different climate change scenarios and then apply these findings to species distribution models predicting shifts in habitats. Furthermore, a mobile application will be developed allowing anyone to upload photos and GPS coordinates to the JaibikMap repository taken during opportunistic sightings of mammal species.",

    "description": "Madagascar National Parks (MNP) has a mandate to manage and conserve its protected area network of more than 2 million hectares of land; therefore, MNP needs efficient ways to collect data that informs its management practices. However, the data collected so far are disparate and are do not cover the diversity of ecosystems under the park system’s purview, a problem that might be rectified by tapping into the biodiversity knowledge of local communities and MNP rangers. Thus, this PEER project focuses on improving and streamlining MNP’s data collection process via integration of local communities. Protected area managers need scientific data and indicators to inform conservation decisions. The project addresses this critical issue by providing local communities the opportunity to participate in the conservation of their local protected areas. Integrating a community-based approach for monitoring biodiversity and regional climate patterns provides major biodiversity payoffs in creating a local economy tied to biodiversity monitoring, which creates value for biodiversity outside of traditional natural resource extraction and use. This project will test whether local communities can collect data and take leadership and ownership over the management of their local protected areas. This effort begins with the protected area network but by building capacity at the community level in monitoring protected areas (Hay Tao), the researchers will facilitate management of resources that spill outside the bounds of the of national parks (Mikajy). Proper land management is not an intrinsically intuitive process and skills must be taught to communities. At the end of the project, the team will assess the ability of the local community to effectively and accurately monitor biodiversity and ecological parameters across our sites, which will be done by contrasting results from their expert team with those of the community-based team.\n \n In carrying out the project, the team will leverage the CLPs, local community groups created by the MNP system with members who are elected or designated by the community to protect the forest. CLP members collect information on environmental pressures and biodiversity, and in this project they will be engaged on a trial basis to monitor and survey biodiversity in the protected areas. At the end of the project, the CLP members will have had an opportunity to enhance their knowledge and community linkages. Training for CLP members will be carried out by the PI and two other students, with additional support provided thanks to collaborations with professors at the University of Antananarivo, University of Florida, and University of Hamburg. During the project, equipment and materials will also be provided by these universities and by the MNP. Ultimately, the research team expects that data collection by local community members using different approaches and protocols will be developed and applied in the MNP to improve overall management of protected areas.",

    "description": "This project addresses the problem of ongoing illegal logging of precious timber species in Madagascar. Madagascar is a source of two commercially important precious woods derived from species in the genera Dalbergia and Diospyros that are known by the vernacular names rosewood, palissander, and ebony. The ever-increasing demand for precious timber on the international market has led to a massive increase of illegal exploitation in Madagascar in recent years. Illegal logging generates almost no benefits for poor local communities, further aggravating the impacts of this illicit enterprise. To support development, it will be essential to reduce illegal trade and concurrently promote sustainable management practices. This project should help Madagascar to control its legacy of precious wood trading by establishing mechanisms for accurate identification. The collection of wood specimens with their associated vouchers and data will provide a much needed reference collection for the species identification of logs and sawn wood that will be of benefit not only to Madagascar but also worldwide.",

Insects offer a far greater range of nutrients than commonly consumed meats yet require a much smaller footprint to produce. In Madagascar, insects are an indispensable part of seasonal diets for many ethnic groups. This research team aims to strengthen the tradition of eating insects with innovative techniques to make this valuable food resource available in all seasons while encouraging forest conservation. Their method will link the benefits of insect farming with a healthy, natural forest habitat. They intend to improve the diets of malnourished children by promoting a farming system that increases the value of the forest in the eyes of local people. The project will first evaluate suitable insect species for commercialization and create a knowledge bank of edible insects of Madagascar. One species will be chosen for protein powder production and another for whole insect consumption. The researchers will conduct experiments to determine optimal conditions for commercial-scale farming, including an evaluation of biological cycles, nutrient content, and other technical variables that affect farming costs and conservation impacts. They will also evaluate local attitudes towards insect consumption to ensure the program is suitable for local markets. The research will be conducted in collaboration with local NGOs, the private sector, and a team of international mentors.\n \n Insect farming can produce a high nutrient protein source with a reduced footprint. Its low-resource demands can relieve pressures on the environment and provide food security. Insect farming can help Madagascar address development issues such as population growth, food security, habitat fragmentation, diminishing water resources, child nutrition, and persistent poverty. For a modest investment, the researchers expect large returns that will advance both development and conservation goals. Their research will be directly applied to the production of whole insects for local consumption and protein powder for commercial sale. In local communities, they aim to empower marginalized groups such as women and the rural poor to produce their own food, thus contributing to regional food security. Farming of whole insects for local consumption will also include the planting of native host trees as part of a reforestation program. In addition, they plan to develop leadership in Madagascar for insect farming research. Findings will be shared freely with the private sector with the aim of promoting a cottage industry of insect farming in Madagascar that will benefit business, the people, and the forest.",

    "description": "Studies of the utility of drought and flood hazard indices indicate that a thorough depiction of hazard risks requires combined analysis of the co-variation of multiple meteorological and terrestrial variables such as rainfall, runoff, and soil moisture conditions. Current hazard estimations do not objectively combine separate indicators into an overall assessment of hazard risks and the impacts of climate variability. In countries such as Sri Lanka and Maldives there are severe constraints on real-time data availability. Such shortfalls can impair the reliability of and access to real-time hazard assessments if based entirely on one source of data. Freely available data from satellite estimates for soil moisture and prediction products from NASA and NOAA can be very useful, and field testing their accuracy in tropical locations should also help in validating them. This project will involve expanding, testing, and implementing a hazard analysis framework for combining multiple terrestrial indicators to estimate the probability of drought and floods. This work builds on studies of hazards, climate and land surface modeling, and disasters previously completed by the research team, some of it in cooperation with the U.S. Government-supported partner. \n \n Sri Lanka is densely populated with high spatial variability in climate and high vulnerability to disasters. Recent droughts have led to drops in economic growth and losses in livelihoods. Floods are a leading causes of loss in life from natural disasters of the population of 21 million. In 2014, a severe drought emergency up to September was followed by flood emergency from till December. The Maldives is a country made up of almost 1,200 small islands, and their isolated location, size, and storage limitations leave the population of 350,000 vulnerable to drought risk. In recent years, there has been more frequent drought and increasing groundwater contamination. Although, climate variability and its impacts on hazards are of critical importance in both countries, the scientific understanding is not equal to the risk, and available information is not adequately accessed. Major policy decisions and large projects related to hazard are being undertaken without a robust basis in current science. The development-related objective of this project is to build integrated assessment, monitoring, and prediction capabilities for natural hazards that will be useful for decision makers. In Sri Lanka, the team will instrument two sites for measuring soil moisture, river levels, and ground water and provide water scarcity assessments to the Water Management Services Panel, building on a weekly climate advisory already provided to this panel. In the Maldives, the focus will be on drought and groundwater assessments, which will be conducted in liason with the Meteorological and Water Supply Services, hydrologists, and instrumentation specialists. The project team will undertake field measurements of meteorology, soil moisture, and the groundwater lens in two regions.",

On one side, the research will contribute to understanding not only what digital technologies fit into which socioeconomic context but also what enabling conditions are required to allow their inclusive use across scales. On the other side, the NSF-funded project headed by the U.S. partner is aimed at studying the drivers of food insecurity in West Africa using a participatory modeling approach. Stakeholders at national and local levels are involved in the modeling process and in identifying drivers of food security and coping mechanisms for food insecurity. Digital technologies are being proposed in Mali as partial solutions to food insecurity. For example, mobile phones are proposed to guide farmer decision-making through expert advice on the issues of concern farmers may have, including the right period for sowing crops and market information like the price and demand for different crops. Digital technologies are also used through the combination of mobile phones and remote sensing to provide extension services, to improve agriculture statistics compilation, and to help define and document land rights, thereby reducing conflict and improving tenure security.

    "description": "Rice is a crucial and strategic cereal crop for more than half of the population in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Mali. Unfortunately, diseases, primarily bacterial leaf blight and rice yellow mottle virus disease, cause the average rice yield to be below the global average. This contributes to economic losses and undermines food security. Chemical pesticides can control pathogen growth and dispersal and improve rice yield, but their high cost and harmful effects on human health and the environment limit their use in smallholder rice farms. Endophytic bacteria, which have been shown to be plant growth-promoting or pathogen-suppressing or to activate plant defense systems, can benefit plants through enhanced resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and plant growth promotion. The use of these bacteria for disease management has great potential in the agricultural systems of West Africa. However, production and use of endophytic bacteria biopesticides has not yet been scaled up for use by farmers in West Africa. \n \n The primary goal of this study is to increase food security in Mali. The specific objective is to improve rice productivity and competitiveness in Mali through the production and integration of endophytic bacterial biopesticides into rice production systems. The main result expected for this project is a the production of effective and low-cost biopesticides and a strategy for long-term sustainable rice pathogen biocontrol technology, which will be tested by smallholder rice farmers in Africa. By producing biopesticides at home and using local microbes and materials, the nations could save as much as $7.2 million per year in scarce foreign exchange money that could be used for government development priorities such as health and education. The project will also provide a much-needed boost to rice and biopesticide sectors, which are currently ailing segments of the economy.

Despite effective implementation of usual control measures such as insecticide treated nets (ITN) and artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) malaria remains the number one killer in Mali. We recently showed that Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC), previously known as Intermittent Preventive Treatment of Malaria in children, reduces malaria infection and disease by more 80% in Malian children, prompting the WHO to approve SMC as policy for countries with seasonal malaria transmission, such as Mali, in March 2012. The strategy is a highly cost-effective approach to reduce childhood mortality in these areas. Despite the huge benefit of the SMC on malaria infection and disease, the optimal approach to deliver SMC remains to be determined and there is no data on the long term effect of this strategy on the development of immunity to malaria. An optimal SMC delivery approach will make a substantial contribution toward the achievement of the goals of the US President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) and the Millenium Development Goals.\n \n The design is a cluster-randomized trial over three years.

The results will be shared with stakeholders, and will be used at the end of each year to guide the implementation of SMC in Mali.",

    "description": "This research will integrate new theories of disequilibrium ecology and human land use practices to develop a human-ecological model of savanna dynamics. In particular, the study will integrate anthropogenic disturbance regimes and disequilibrium ecology principles to determine their impacts on tree establishment and growth. Answers to these questions have clear implications for tree cover, carbon sequestration, and human livelihoods, especially for women, who most often gather, utilize, and sell valued tree products. This study will provide valuable baseline data on tree phenology for an understudied part of the world and will address questions pertaining to the basic science of savanna ecology by answering fundamental questions about competition between grasses and trees at different life-cycle phases. This project will advance human ecology by integrating it with disequilibrium savanna ecological theory to quantify how particular human activities affect plant distributions and vegetation characteristics. It will produce spatially and temporally explicit evidence of landscape change, and clarify processes through which human activities have affected vegetation characteristics. This study will advance biogeography by clarifying how socioeconomic and biophysical factors contribute to range expansion for tropical tree species. Finally, this research will suggest practical strategies to conserve and enhance parkland vegetation, based on the relationships between indigenous management practices and vegetation diversity. Natural resource management laws in West Africa often emphasize prohibiting particular activities even though the basis for such prohibitions are poorly grounded in scientific or local knowledge of ecological processes. By identifying processes that contribute to parkland development, this project will improve management of renewable resources, biodiversity, and sequestered carbon. \n \n Highly valued native trees in Mali are rarely planted, rather they propagate quasi-naturally, often on agricultural, fallow, and open savanna lands; nevertheless, the Malian landscape is defined by its productive agroforestry parklands. This study will determine the conditions under which specific highly values tree species establish, escape fire and browsing, establish, and mature. Woodlands in Mali are under increasing pressure as they provide numerous resources for the rural (and urban) populations. Trees not only are used as the primary source of energy for Mali (fuel-wood and charcoal) but they provide food and cash opportunities, as well as fodder for a growing animal husbandry industry. The well-known shea butter market is only one example of a specific tree that provides high economic benefits. Surprisingly, very little is known about other highly valued native tree species. This study will provide this basic information for at least ten highly valued tree species, which will lead to improved land management practices resulting in increased tree survival and growth rates and thus increased resiliency of rural populations who tend to rely heavily on native plants during times of drought and/or poor agricultural harvests. Moreover, the study will provide scientific data on the potential to develop a native tree crop industry, which has, to date, been poorly developed due to a lack of basic knowledge on native trees. Finally, the study will broaden opportunities for the African university students and researchers. It will train a team of Malian foresters and faculty to use UAVs to gather environmental data. The researchers will introduce the use of UAVs as an inexpensive means to gather remotely sensed data on vegetation cover and ecosystem health at the village landscape scale.",

    "description": "Climate change will impact the Mexican population’s wellbeing over the next decades. There are few worldwide studies that consider the impact of mitigation policy on poverty, and no estimation of corresponding scenarios for Mexico, since integrated analysis of climate impacts and mitigation policy is very novel. In order to design sound development policies, it is imperative to understand the linkages between poverty risks and climate change, as well as quantifying how mitigation targets would diminish or increase such risks in the short and long run. This research study will examine the combined implications of climate impact and mitigation policy for poor households, through their effects on agriculture and energy, addressing limitations of current research. The research team will aim to: (1) enhance the representation of Mexico’s development trends for climate change scenarios, with an updated and detailed survey analysis of demographics, income and consumption of Mexican households over time for iPETS; (2) develop climate and socioeconomic scenarios for Mexico, in a global context; (3) examine the joint consequences of climate impacts and mitigation policy on households: variations in the number of poor households, as food prices respond to impacts on crop productivity and land availability; energy prices impact on poverty headcounts under climate policy; and whether demographic and income transformations might offset food and energy prices effects, under different adaptation and mitigation policies that might alleviate negative consequences on poverty; and (4) foster capacity building for climate and socioeconomic scenario research among researchers and policy makers in Mexico. \n \n The research team in collaboration with the U.S. partner will train, strengthen, and better inform researchers, graduate students, and policy makers on the use of climate and socioeconomic scenarios, fostering their capacity to evaluate the welfare implications of climate policy. In order to achieve this, the project will include different venues for presenting the fundamentals of scenario design using integrated assessment models (IAMs). The project will pay special attention to climate-change implications for households, arising from socioeconomic pathways and demographic heterogeneity. Since the impacts are likely to be uneven, identifying differential effects across household groups would serve as an important input for development of better policies in Mexico, given its large demographic and social inequality. The research project will contribute to USAID’s goal of decreasing vulnerability to poverty. Although Mexico has estimates about mitigation costs for the country, there is no study that evaluates how global climate policy will impact its population, and to what extent future social and economic transformations could balance such effects. This project, with its integrated approach, should help inform Mexican policy makers on mitigation and adaptation policies, and how they can be designed without harming poor household groups.",

    "description": "The mismatch between the job supply and demand creates major social, political, and economic problems in Morocco. Every year, many graduates are unable to find jobs, and the resulting youth unemployment causes major social and political tensions. Paradoxically, at the same time, employers are unable to find candidates with the required skills, and this skills shortage results in missed economic opportunities for the country. Despite the importance of the studying skill mismatch in Morocco, the topic attracts very limited attention in the literature. Moreover, there is a lack of large data sets that researchers can use to systematically study the issue and identify effective interventions to alleviate it. \n \n The goal of this project is to measure the skill mismatch in Morocco and identify measures to align university training with the job market. More specifically, these researchers will collect and analyze multiple large data sets about higher education and the job market in Morocco. They will build profiles of university graduates and job openings in Morocco and identify areas of misalignment between the two. They will also interview human resources staff from multiple organizations to learn about their concerns in more detail. Finally, they will collect traditional and social media discussions about higher education and jobs in Morocco in order to learn about the general population’s concerns about the topic. This project should lead to advances in both education and computer science, and the analysis to be conducted should yield deep and novel insight about areas of mismatch between higher education and the job market in Morocco.",

    "name": "PEER - Seamless Solar PV Integration in Moroccan Buildings\n PEER5-198",
    "description": "A high density of installed photovoltaic (PV) systems poses grid integration challenges. Excessive ramps and peaks of the injected PV power into low-voltage grids are some of the most important challenges that may destabilize the grid and even cause blackouts. The penetration of PV in buildings in Morocco is still very low. The potential for roof-mounted PV power generation in Morocco has been estimated to each 10TWh, representing 40% of the country's total electricity consumption. Despite this high potential, there are two main obstacles to the uptake of PV in buildings, the first being the capital investment cost, as no financial incentives are offered yet by the government, and the second being the conservative attitude of the national electricity utility company toward PV injection in the low-voltage grid. \n \n To optimally design a battery-supported PV system, realistic household load profiles in Morocco must be used. The general objectives of this project are (1) to build a statistically significant dataset of household electricity consumption profiles in Morocco and make it available as open data to the scientific community; (2) to analyze the data using machine learning to assess and classify power quality at the household level; and (3) to develop scientific tools to investigate issues of sizing and operation of residential battery-supported PV systems in Moroccan settings from both the energetic and economic perspectives. Forecast-based control mechanisms will be devised for different scenarios. The results of the project should be of interest to the Moroccan Ministry of Energy and the national electric utility company. The International University of Rabat encourages through its technology transfer unit joint ventures with industry to turn research results into commercial products. The research team will explore this avenue at the end of the project. Overall, through their planned open data platform and outreach activities, the project team aims to contribute to the promotion of clean energy adoption in buildings and the modernization of the Moroccan electric grid.",

    "name": "PEER - Towards Smart Microgrids: Renewable Energy Integration into Smart Buildings\n PEER5-398a",
    "description": "Besides being a global concern, energy efficiency is growing as a potential market with very promising development and environmental impacts. Smart Grids (SGs) promote energy efficiency in electrical grids, mainly via the integration of renewable energy (thus minimizing greenhouse gas emissions) and via the leveraging of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). ICT is a key element in the optimization of the Demand/Response (DR) variance, which stipulates a real-time dissemination of data between SG components, namely, smart meters at the production site (i.e., renewable energy sources), sensors measuring electricity consumption at the consumer site, and actuators. The interconnection of these components needs a reliable network: the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI).\n \n This project will leverage energy efficiency in smart buildings by promoting “context awareness” whereby the switching on and off of electrical appliances will be based on the context, i.e., temperature, number of people in rooms, humidity, light, and so forth. To this end, these researchers plan to deploy a holistic platform that implements a real-world microgrid testbed at a building on the Alakhawayn University campus. The deployed smart microgrid model will be promoted for deployment by other organizations at the national level, especially since Morocco is adopting a promising policy for renewable energy integration. In the medium term, the team hopes to promote this technology in sub-Saharan countries as well, given Morocco's geographical location. Supporting research in renewable energy can foster the growth of the green economy in Morocco and in the longer term create job opportunities for Moroccan youth. The project intends to have a positive impact in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in line with USAID's Global Climate Change and Development Strategy. It is also in line with a Moroccan national initiative to promote renewable energy development.",

Nepal represents an ideal setting to pilot this study based on its robust national community health worker network, progressive national healthcare priorities, and the team's personal experience in delivering healthcare in a district public healthcare setting since 2008. The intervention integrates three evidence-based approaches for maternal, newborn, and child health: (1) group antenatal and postnatal care to improve the institutional birth rate and reduce mortality among children under age two; (2) a Community Health Worker (CHW) model of home-based care to monitor and increase utilization of services, maternal and neonatal health knowledge, self-efficacy, social support, and emergency planning among mothers; and (3) a mentoring approach to quality improvement targeted at government clinic providers in the study population. This intervention will be implemented and tested in the district of Achham, Far-West Nepal, within a district population of 260,000. Achham is one of 20 priority districts under USAID’s development strategy in Nepal.\n \n The study aims to analyze the impact of the integrated care package on institutional birth rates and under-two mortality using community household survey data. The researchers will assess the mechanisms of the impact of group integrated care and assess the efficacy of targeted CHW protocols for a home-based model of care delivery to address maternal, neonatal, and child care, in addition to chronic disease care, continuous surveillance, and mortality assessment. They will describe key aspects of the implementation process, including costs, human resources, logistics, and fidelity of the group integrated care program to model content and processes. Finally, they will produce a cost-effectivness analysis to determine affordability for national government adoption and Possible’s care delivery model. It is expected that the interventions should decrease infant mortality and morbidity, increase the percent of births that occur in a monitored setting, and increase subsequent contraceptive use.",

    "description": "Contamination of vegetables and fruits by pesticides and endoparasites is a major public health concern in developing countries, including Nepal. Pesticides are widely used worldwide to protect crops from pests, but their excessive and unmanaged use is harmful to humans and the ecosystem. Pesticides are well-known toxins that cause acute and delayed health effects, including disruption of the central and peripheral nervous systems and cancer. Similarly, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 8% of total deaths reported in Southeast Asia are caused by diarrhea. In Nepal, several instances of diarrheal outbreaks are reported every year. Human exposure to pesticides and parasites is due to contaminated food and water. Concerns over food pollution are rising in Nepal, but science-based understanding of the level of pollution is limited, due in part to the unavailability of reliable, economical, easy-to-use, and rapid field test methods to be used as important early warning tools for consumers. Conventional methods for determining pesticide residues on food involve sophisticated, time-consuming, expensive chromatographic methods that require advanced lab facilities and skilled operators. Similarly, endoparasite oocysts in food products are identified using expensive, high resolution optical microscopes, immunofluorescence-based microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction techniques that are not suitable for field screening of samples in developing countries. This project aims to develop (1) a paper-based pesticide residue assay and (2) smartphone-based oocyst assay methods. Both of these high throughput, low-cost, easy methods will be first developed and validated in the laboratory and later tested with vegetable samples at various locations across Nepal. It will be the first large-scale field testing of these methods with real samples. Other activities on the project will include providing training to students and government technicians, organizing workshops for concerned stakeholders, creating online map with field results, and disseminating information. Bringing reliable assay methods for pesticide residue and oocysts for public use with the possibility of commercialization will be the major output of the project. The USG-supported partner will provide technical advice and training for both the lab development and field testing components.\n \n In addition, the team will involve undergraduate students from the Tri-Chandra Multiple Campus, Tribhuvan University. They will learn to use the newly developed assay methods and go into the field to test food pollution levels. In addition, two Master’s students from the Central Department of Environmental Science, Tribhuvan University, will be given the opportunity to carry out their thesis work in the framework of this project. The PI and his colleagues will share their field screening findings and involve the Plant Protection Directorate (PPD) of the Government of Nepal. PPD technicians will be trained in the new methods and be given some of the assay tools. Two workshops and one symposium will also be organized to share the results of the project.",

    "description": "The main goal of this project is to investigate the phenomenon of open mapping and develop a framework and guiding principles to conduct outreach, motivate, train, and engage citizen volunteers, particularly youth, in mapping. Nepal has one of the most active open mapping communities in the developing countries. There is a huge potential to engage digital volunteers and map unmapped parts of the world (Goodchild, 2007). Citizens can contribute their local knowledge to open mapping platforms using the Global Positioning System (GPS) capability of their mobile devices and the Internet. Citizens do have a wide range of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to participate in open mapping, yet despite such potential, our scientific understanding on how to recruit, engage, and retain citizens in open mapping remains poorly understood, especially in the context of developing nations.\n \n This study aims to fill the above research gap. The study will employ action research methodology, as this makes it possible to expand mapping work alongside research activities. Eight mapping workshops will be organized in two cities in Nepal during the project period. In addition to creating maps, the research team will also train a wide range of potential users and develop their skills to use open map data effectively. The research should open avenues for the young local technology community to develop public participation software applications using open map data, catalyzing a new market. The research will also engage Nepal in the emergent areas of open government and open mapping, which are cutting edge in the United States and other advanced countries.

    "name": "PEER - ENHANCED ENGAGEMENT IN RESEARCH on KABUL RIVER BASIN (EKaRB)\n PEER4-255",
    "description": "The Indus river system originates in the Himalayas in northern Pakistan, flows across three provinces, and meets the Arabian Sea at its southern end. It has many tributaries that contribute to its flow, and one of its most important is the Kabul River system, which contributes almost 19 MAF of water at Attock annually (IUCN, 2013). Historical data from 1937 through 2008 show a considerable decrease in annual flows in the Kabul river system, from 28 to 19 MAF. The possible reasons could be climatic variability, persistent drought, or enhanced use of water in Afghanistan. The Kabul river basin (KRB) has its unique geographical importance as it originates from Pakistan, enters Afghanistan and then comes back to Pakistan. In that sense Pakistan and Afghanistan are both upper and lower riparian states. Its tributaries—namely Bara, Konar, and Swat—originate in Pakistan. These contribute to the flows of KRB, which covers 348 miles in Afghanistan and then enters Pakistan to join the Indus River at Attock. It is in the interest of both Afghanistan and Pakistan to have evidence-based knowledge on the variability in flows of KRB and future impacts of climate change. \n \n The lead institute on this project, IMWI, has partnered with the National Centre of Excellence in Geology in Peshawar, with the U.S. Government-supported partner being the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). In addition, IWMI has made contacts with the Afghan Ministry of Energy and Water, which has shown keen interest in the project idea has indicated that Kabul University may become involved. The project researchers will investigate the impact of climate change on the highly varying flows of KRB, where the ratio between lowest and highest annual flows is 1:3 (IUCN, 2013). Afghanistan has planned multiple storage facilities on KRB for irrigation and power generation purposes, and these will directly impact supplies of water to the Indus river basin. This could result in potential transboundary water conflicts in the absence of any treaty between the two riparian states. In order to facilitate any meaningful negotiation between the two states, the first step is to develop a scientific repository of evidence based research on KRB that provides insights into future water resource development scenarios in Afghanistan with and without climate change impacts. Pakistan’s economy is heavily dependent on its agricultural produce, with about 70% of its population earning a living through agriculture. Because surface water from rivers is a key input to agriculture, any uncertainty in future water supplies will directly affect the economy of Pakistan and increase poverty. On the Afghan side, the project aims to contribute to the important goal of sustainable agriculture-led economic growth. This will be achieved by informing Afghan policy makers through the dissemination of project findings about the impact of climate change on the variability of flows in KRB and the need to adapt to the changing climate patterns.",

    "description": "Scientific information on water availability/use and climatic impacts in the Kabul river basin is much needed and can provide a foundation for any future discourse on the basin. Augmenting the problem, climate change has inserted a layer of complexity over the already challenging water governance issues (Zhu et al., 2013; Habib et al., 2013; Beekma & Fiddes, 2011). Keeping in mind the scarcity of research in the Kabul River Basin and lack of data in the region, Phase 1 of the project will include a scientific study using remote sensing data to better understand water availability in the basin and the impacts of climate change. In Phase 2 the project team will explore avenues of water-related cooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan and will propose an integrated basin wide approach for the governance, management and development of the transboundary Kabul river basin waters. The U.S. Government-supported partners will provide remote sensing and GIS data support to supplement available data over the Kabul river basin, offer advice on large basin-level hydrological modeling approaches, mentor graduate students and young researchers involved in the project, and review \n and provide quality control to the various project knowledge outputs.\n \n Both Afghanistan and Pakistan have serious governance and security challenges that are impeding their future development and growth prospects. To make matters worse, the relationship between the two countries has deteriorated due to cross-border terrorism, extremism, violence, and a worsening security situation. Both countries also face common issues such as economic growth, food security, energy security, and agriculture productivity, and water is key to achieving meaningful results in all these areas. For both Pakistan and Afghanistan water is vital to the social and economic well-being of population and also for peace and stability in the region. The centrality of water for both countries makes the transboundary Kabul River Basin an extremely important shared resource. It is of utmost importance to study the nature of this valuable resource and explore options where an integrated basin wide approach can be undertaken for its management, governance and development.",

    "description": "Transboundary water resources systems are constrained by complex social, economic, and environmental processes that require decision making in a sophisticated framework involving many stakeholders, who are directly or indirectly affected by those decisions. The transboundary Kabul River Basin is no exception to such challenges, where sensitive geopolitical relationships and an unconventional political order have arrested efforts for any cooperative water resources management system between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Current river basin management is very fragmented and narrow in scope. Decisions are often made without a full appreciation of the cross-sectoral impacts and socioeconomic implications. The aim of this project is to support policy makers in both countries to work towards a benefit-sharing approach for the Kabul River Basin. Development of the case for this approach will be based on scientific analysis supported by a strong stakeholder and public policy engagement process to ensure that the outputs are impactful and reflective of the stakeholders’ aspirations. \n \n A systems modeling approach for optimized water resources management in the Kabul River Basin will be implemented to provide a strong scientific basis for a benefit-sharing regime between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The project will address how natural, social, and environmental drivers combine to impact transboundary water management in the Kabul River Basin. This advances scientific knowledge and technical capabilities in two primary ways:\n By developing an enhanced, spatially distributed, glacial hydrology model and coupling it with a water resources systems model. To deal with the data-scarce nature of the study area, model calibration and optimization will account for the various sources of uncertainty by making use of high-performance computing.\n By incorporating a feedback mechanism in the coupled-modeling approach where the decision from one agent impacts the decision from the other and vice versa. This allows for a better reflection of real world decision making. Embedding the technical analysis within a comprehensive stakeholder and public policy engagement framework should also improve knowledge accessibility and drive long-term policy action.\n Water resources are crucial for the development and economic prosperity of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The transboundary Kabul River Basin presents a strategic opportunity for the neighboring countries to develop a cooperative water resources management framework that can maximize the benefits for both sides. Unfortunately, historical geopolitical tensions and regional dynamics have created an atmosphere of mistrust where both countries are undertaking unilateral policy action on the river basin that will have implications for downstream communities. The project team is a unique interdisciplinary collaboration between international academic institutions, policy research organizations, and government departments, which should help to ensure that their modeling efforts and analysis are grounded in reality and thus more effective and more likely to be adopted by stakeholders.",

    "description": "This project focuses on Ecological Infrastructure as an adaptation strategy for ensuring water sustainability in South America’s Semi-Andes region. Dr. Willems and his team seek to advance our understanding of ecohydrologic processes that take place in headwaters ecosystems, effects of changes in climate and anthropogenic drivers, and how these are reflected in the water supply along the basin. Andean puna wetlands are far less studied than tropical glaciers, but they play an even more crucial role in the hydrology of the majority of Peru’s Andean basins and hence in the provision of water to urban and productive centers of the country. As glaciers have almost disappeared in the team’s study site, this project will produce relevant information for climate change adaptation plans by generating new knowledge about post-glacier hydrological processes in the Andes. In addition, the researchers will study the eco-hydrological properties of human-made water-regulating ecosystems and their scalability for ecological interventions in urban and rural areas. On the social science side, the team aims to better understand how actors make decisions around Ecological Infrastructure. Specifically, they want to know how decision-makers receive information and learn about ecological infrastructure design and implementation, as well as what obstacles they face in understanding and advancing ecological infrastructure. This entails understanding trade-offs decision-makers face with regard to strategic planning, public investments, and institutional capability. Overall, the objective of this project is to establish an integrated, participatory approach to the design and implementation of Ecological Infrastructure Strategies that can be utilized in Peru’s Andean urban centers and communities. This research will address a key challenge in understanding how society undergoes changes in the use and distribution of environmental resources, and it should contribute to our understanding of decision-making around water sustainability more broadly. Throughout the project, they will work closely with the University of Ayacucho (UNSCH) on the implementation of the Regional Research Institute for Water – Food – Energy Security (ir-NEXUS), which is envisioned as a think-tank that supports policy formulation and public investment processes with relevance to the local and the Andean region sustainable development. Finally, they will support the implementation of postgraduate programs at UNSCH to actively involve graduate students in the natural and social sciences.\n \n The project is aligned with USAID’s new Adaptation Flagship Program for Peru, in which green infrastructure investments in watersheds are a key adaptation strategy. The project site (the headwaters of the Cachi basin and the 180,000-inhabitant city of Huamanga in Ayacucho) was selected to align with USAID’s focal regions within Peru. To promote interdisciplinary research and develop effective ways of mobilizing science to address societal needs, Dr. Willems and his team plan several specific activities. They will develop robust scenarios pertaining to the water supply in the region under different global change pathways. These scenarios will be implemented together with the Regional Government of Ayacucho, local governments, and the local water authority, institutions responsible for elaborating the policy, strategy, local planning, and regulation of water resources. The researchers will also develop Ecological Infrastructure Strategies by integrating natural and man-made water-regulating ecosystems with landscape planning, urban planning, and water and wastewater management, giving due and balanced consideration to social, economic, and environmental factors and involving local authorities and community organizations. These EIS will facilitate the incorporation of ecological infrastructure within water planning investments.

    "description": "Exposure to lead (Pb) in contaminated soil is a significant health threat for children throughout Peru, a country with a long history of mining. However, Peru does not have the resources to carry out expensive laboratory or field tests to identify hot spots of lead contamination. For this project, the PI Dr. Ponce-Canchihuamán and his team will collaborate with U.S. partner Dr. Alexander van Geen to use a new field kit for Pb in soil developed at Columbia University. They will sample potentially contaminated soils in areas representing four different contamination types in Lima East, Callao, La Oroya, and Cerro de Pasco. This kit is intended for public use, so the team will work with local high schools to deploy the kits as a hands-on project component in a science course to assess its feasibility for a national-scale deployment, ensure data reliability, and improve local education. The researchers will train high school teachers and selected high school students to use the field kit and will provide enough kits to conduct measurements on 10,000 soil samples (about 2,500 per community) over three years. The teachers will incorporate deployment of the field kit into their courses, and with the PEER team’s support, teach students about lead, its origin, and its health impacts, as well as how to use the kit for soil sampling. Students will be asked to take five soil or house dust samples in their community where young children play and record sample details such as GPS location using the SurveyCTO app (http://www.surveycto.com) on a provided smartphone. Afterwards, teachers will supervise the soil analysis with the kit to determine the lead level. This will ensure data reliability and consistency and allow for student discussion about kit chemistry. Finally, the students will create maps of soil lead and present these to their community, along with information about lead, its risks, and how to minimize the exposure of infants, in particular. \n \n The project will enable the researchers to identify areas of high lead risk in communities that are impacted by different lead-contaminating industries, including battery recycling (Lima), ore mining (Cerro de Pasco), smelting (La Oroya), and ore shipping (Callao). Through the schools, the maps will be used to help the affected communities to develop a local action plan. This project will help empower local communities to identify lead contaminated areas and safe areas, which they otherwise would not have had the means to test. The availability to generate locally generated environmental data can help rebuild trust and empower communities to prioritize contaminated areas. This in turn can enable industries that are perceived as contaminating but really are not to contribute to the economic growth of the town. Communities will also be able to develop a plan for how to prevent exposure of young children. The lead field kit the team seeks to validate in Peru presents an affordable way to find and prioritize areas for clean up, and its deployment through high school science classes offers a sustainable way to scale up these kits while improving science education. Over the three years of the project, local development impacts will include the training and education of 2,000 students and their science teachers and the analysis of 10,000 soil samples. Students will create a map of soil lead risk and present these to their community, along with basic information about lead and how to prevent exposure. By incorporating the kit into science classes, students benefit from a hands-on activity to produce relevant environmental measures while learning chemistry and technology. University students involved in the project will also gain valuable fieldwork experience supporting the deployment of the field kit and be able to use this as part of their thesis. In addition, the experience will help to establish whether this participatory citizen science approach benefitting science and technology education, as well as public health, could be scaled up nationally. The results will be used in collaboration with various actors and stakeholders to develop a national plan to identify and reduce lead exposure.",

    "description": "Cloud forest environments respond strongly even to small changes in temperature and a large fraction of the species assessed is vulnerable to extinction due to climate change. Species distributions can be strongly influenced by many factors, one is geographic and another is the existence of potential ecological barriers to forces driving altitudinal migrations of tree species. Dr. Salinas and her team contend that there are several important human actions that can have a significant impact on species migration along the treeline. A better understanding of the factors involved should greatly improve our ability to predict if, and also where and how, species will migrate. This project aims to contribute to current knowledge of the complex dynamics of treeline ecotones by reevaluating the question of tree species migration into highland grasslands in light of microenvironmental and microbiotic information. The researchers on this PEER project propose that it is possible to control and manage the factors, both environmental and human, that inhibit species migration through activities similar to those undertaken in other, less extreme, environments such as Central American or Afromontane forests (Strobl et al., 2011).\n \n There have been few studies that have evaluated the importance of human impact in the tree line migrations into grassland. A better understanding of how species distribution and survival are likely to be affected can provide better guidance to conservation strategies and their integration into socially effective programs in the face of climate change. The project will be conducted in areas located at the border of the Cuzco and Madre de Dios regions in southeastern Peru, within and surrounding the Manu National Park. Planned project activities are designed to help strengthen environmental governance through a mitigation-oriented management program of the treeline in the park in collaboration with park personnel and local communities. The project team will work with NGOs currently involved in forest management initiatives in the area to help local communities develop forestry-based alternative revenue sources along the treeline. The goal is reducing the pressure of livestock grazing within park boundaries through alternative stakeholder revenue-earning strategies for communities that presently use national park land for their livestock. Overall, the project should help preserve biodiversity, ecological services, and food and water security for the Kosñipata basin.",

    "description": "The province of Bohol was recently struck by earthquake and swept by Typhoon Haiyan, creating destruction and interruption of health services. Included in the disruption were TB screening, prevention and DOTS programs. In addition to concerns over the disruption of services, extensive crowding in emergency shelters and camps potentially put children at higher risk for exposure to TB.\n \n Study Rationale: Although there is very limited evidence to guide TB control strategies during displacement following natural disasters, interagency guidelines have been developed to address TB treatment in the acute and recovery periods following a complex emergency. The importance of reconstructing TB services during the post-conflict phase is well recognized and requires coordination and collaboration among key stakeholders. Experience has demonstrated that major impediments to successful reconstruction of TB services include mobile populations, destroyed infrastructure, and lack of coordination and/or interest in TB treatment, leading to poor case detection and sub-optimal TB control. However, all of these challenges are also opportunities to introduce interventions to improve TB control.\n \n Proposed Design: (1) Cross-sectional cluster survey using rapid assessment methods to determine the prevalence of TB infection and disease in children under age 15, and (2) a descriptive study using social science mixed methods to assess barriers to pediatric TB control, prevention, and treatment post-disaster.\n \n Geographic Area and Target Population: Bohol, Philippines. Children affected by health emergencies and disasters.\n \n Anticipated Outcome: Assessment of prevalence and risk of TB infection and disease among children displaced by health emergencies and disasters. An understanding of how the disasters impacted TB treatment, prevention, and control.\n \n Objectives: To assess prevalence of TB infection and disease in children under age 15 in Bohol and determine if risk for TB disease increased due to displacement associated with densely populated transitional housing, or increase in household members resulting from natural disasters affecting the island in 2013. Aim 1: Estimate prevalence of TB disease in children in the community and those currently residing or having a history of residing in disaster camps/shelters in Bohol using rapid assessment cross-sectional cluster survey methods. Aim 2: Assess correlation between validated risk factor assessment score and positive TB cases and compare actual prevalence of TB to baseline as well as differences in prevalence in displaced versus non-displaced children. Aim 3: Examine sensitivity and specificity of GeneXpert in sputum and stool as compared to direct smear. Aim 4: Document barriers to implementation of IPT and document additional barriers/disruption of services that occurred post-disaster.",

    "name": "PEER - Effect of a smoking cessation intervention program for families of children diagnosed with TB\n PEER H2-007",
    "description": "The Philippine Program for Tuberculosis has largely focused on adult TB. Recently childhood TB has been addressed because they have more serious clinical presentations and the patients usually become the reservoir for adult TB cases. However, issues on the implementation of the childhood TB program identified problems with the clinical diagnosis and treatment of children with TB. As a result, the Philippines case detection rate for childhood TB is very low at twelve percent (12%). Children are a particularly vulnerable group with a developing immune system exposed to environmental modulators affecting this system. Substances found in tobacco have been shown to have effects not only in carcinogenesis, but in the susceptibility to diseases such as TB. In the 2011 Global Youth Tobacco Survey, it showed 48% of youth are exposed to smoke inside the homes. The study aims to look into correlation of serum cotinine levels due to tobacco use and exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) in children diagnosed with active and latent TB disease. It also aims to look into effects of a brief advice on smoking cessation and a tobacco control resource center in a community health center on outcomes of treatment of active cases of TB in children. Specifically, the study would like to look into the following: 1. The correlation of the level of urine cotinine, used as a proxy measure of secondhand smoke exposure, with the development of active TB and latent TB in children; 2.To determine the effect of a brief advice on smoking cessation on the number of quit attempts of smoking parents and/or guardians of the child diagnosed with pulmonary TB; and 3. To determine the effect of secondhand smoke exposure of children diagnosed with pulmonary TB on time to resolution of the child’s clinical signs and symptoms related to TB. The research proposed is a case control study on a community in Pampanga with a population of 230,000. Exposure to tobacco use and SHS will be determined with a validated interview tool developed by Richmond Center and the USG-supported partner which will be translated and adapted to the local environment and correlated with levels of urine cotinine. The urinary cotinine levels will be compared among those children without TB disease and with TB disease, both latent and active. A tobacco cessation intervention composed of brief advice by healthcare workers will be conducted on TB patients identified to have been exposed to tobacco or SHS. The effect on treatment of TB in children will be correlated with smoking cessation or decreased exposure to SHS and levels of urinary cotinine. The computed sample size for this study is two hundred fifty (250) children. The primary hypothesis is that tobacco use and SHS exposure predisposes children to TB disease. The second hypothesis is that a brief advice for smoking cessation will increase quit attempts and quit rates of smoking which will result in decreased levels of exposure to SHS.",

    "description": "Childhood tuberculosis (TB) in the Philippines remains under-diagnosed, despite significant gains in the control of adult cases of TB. Learning from our experience in the previous year from a prospective community-based surveillance for TB in San Juan, Batangas, Philippines, we propose various interventions to increase case detection and improve treatment outcomes of TB in the Philippines. We propose to conduct a cluster-randomized field trial to assess the effect of an intervention package on tuberculosis case finding, treatment outcomes, and identification of children for isoniazid preventive therapy. The intervention package will be implemented in randomly chosen barangays of two study sites. Aside from the childhood TB activities included in the National Tuberculosis and Control Programme (NTP) manual, no additional interventions will be offered in the rest of the barangays. This package includes: a) enhanced contact tracing through the use of a mobile phone application (app) that automatically notifies barangay health workers (BHW) of patients enrolled in the NTP; b) reinforce public health programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) and the nutrition program requiring referral of children with prolonged cough or fever, or with acute malnutrition for assessment of TB; c) use of an USAID-funded field guide for health workers on childhood TB; d) use of nasopharyngeal aspirates as a specimen for microbiologic testing among children who cannot expectorate; e) use of a phone app that automatically informs patient’s follow-up date; and f) use of text (or SMS) blasts to provide TB health education to enrolled study subjects. This proposal will utilize existing programs as well as collaborate with a USG-supported partner who will provide support in all aspects of the proposed project, including study design, study implementation, clinical, epidemiologic and laboratory training of study personnel (if necessary), laboratory analysis of specimens, data analysis, manuscript preparation and dissemination of study findings. If proven effective, this package of interventions may be easily adapted into local practice since public health programs are already in place. Automated notifications will increase the efficiency of the NTP through enhanced contact tracing and improved case detection. Findings from this proposal can be readily implemented within the system because it uses the existing framework for health care in the communities. It uses existing technologies that may be harnessed to enhance health care delivery and TB control in the Philippines.",

    "description": "The Northern Philippines is not exempt from the burden of childhood tuberculosis (TB), given its geographical locations with mountains and urbanizing valleys in all three regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, and the Cordilleras, encompassing ten provinces and seven cities. The project will use contact tracing among adults with smear-positive TB in order to assess the disease prevalence and incidence among children in the Northern Philippines, and it will identify a spectrum of barriers to the diagnosis and treatment of childhood TB. Household contact investigations will be conducted among smear-positive index patients on TB treatment through DOTS/health facilities (public or private) within the three regions to screen for and obtain accurate baseline statistics of childhood TB and latent TB infection among children under 15. Cross-sectional surveys, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions will be employed among families and healthcare workers to identify barriers to the diagnosis and treatment of childhood TB. Results of the survey will be used to inform an educational campaign that builds upon the strategies of the Department of Health of the Philippines for improving lung health in children affected by tuberculosis.\n \n The project aims to increase pediatric TB case detection from 1.2% to 15%, the global average detection rate for high TB-burden countries. Identification of barriers affecting treatment will inform methods to improve successful implementation of national childhood TB guidelines in the Philippines. The community-based education campaign will serve as an important advocacy tool for the lung health of children and will help decrease the stigma associated with TB. The global community is working towards the goal of “Zero TB deaths among children.” Completion of the project aims will provide critical evidence about the burden of TB-exposed and diseased children in rural Northern Philippines. Contact investigations will build research capacity among individuals and at the programmatic and institutional levels. It will also foster local capacity building at the grassroots level by promoting educational campaigns. Active case finding will generate accurate baseline statistics on TB-exposed children from an understudied region, which can aid in resource allocation and benchmark creation for future programs.",

This will contribute to addressing the knowledge gap on the contribution of agro-ecosystems to the dissemination of AR resistance in the environment in South Africa. Access to safe potable water is a basic human right.

Following consultation with key stakeholders, the research team will select study sites where the risk for fecal bacterial contamination is high due to anthropogenic activities. They will compare levels of antimicrobial resistance prevalence in rural versus urban settings and organic farming versus intensive commercial farming, which should contribute towards an improved understanding of the role of agricultural practices on driving AR development in the agricultural ecosystem. Hazard analysis coupled with pollution source tracking within a specific area will facilitate the assessment of the potential impact on public health. \n \n The impact of this research should also provide water management services, government officials, and farmers with a knowledge base of “hotspots” where irrigation water quality has been severely compromised in South Africa.

    "description": "In low-resource settings, lack of safe water and adequate sanitation has long-term detrimental consequences for child health and development. Continuous exposure to unclean water can lead to poor linear growth among children. In a recent study conducted on the study population that will be the focus of this PEER project, the Dzimauli community of Limpopo, South Africa, the prevalence of stunting increased from 12% in first month of life to 37% at 2 years of age. Stunting early in life is an important marker of long-term morbidity and has been associated with cognitive impairment, poor school performance, low adult economic productivity, and increased risk of chronic disease later in life. Interventions that improve access to safe water and sanitation have the potential to make a significant impact on child stunting but have not been well-studied towards this aim. The municipal water supply for the Dzimauli community is not consistent, and community-level water treatment systems are not available. Less than 20% of households reported treating their drinking water in 2009, which suggests that there is a clear need for an acceptable drinking water solution. \n \n The U.S. partner Dr. James Smith and his research team at the University of Virginia have participated in the development of two point-of-use water treatment technologies that have demonstrated technical efficacy, sustainability, and social acceptance in several low-resource communities: the silver-impregnated ceramic water filter and the silver-impregnated ceramic disk, called a MadiDrop. However, it is unknown whether the use of these technologies will translate to improvements in child health outcomes. This PEER project will involve a community-based intervention trial that will estimate the effectiveness of the two technologies to reduce pathogen exposure and prevent stunting among children in Limpopo. Dr. Smith will manage use of the technologies during the trial and provide support in developing study materials and laboratory protocols. Estimates of effectiveness demonstrated in this trial will provide the necessary evidence base to support the scale-up of manufacturing and distribution of the products. In this way, this research will support interventions that have the potential to contribute to the World Health Organization target to reduce the number of stunted children under 5 years of age by 40% by 2025. This project will lead to capacity building locally at the University of Venda (UNIVEN), which is a rural and historically disadvantaged university in South Africa. More than 40 students and staff will be trained, including students and trainees from the University of Virginia, our USG-supported partner’s university. The PI and his colleagues also plan to participate in community outreach to generate interest in scientific research among youth (high school students) in Limpopo in collaboration with the Vuwani Science Resource Centre. If the technology is proven effective, it will result in policy recommendations to local agencies. In addition, the project will support local commercialization of the ceramic water filter, thereby increasing opportunities for the highly skilled women who make them from locally-sourced materials.",

    "description": "As groundwater resources are increasingly developed and impacted by human development, understanding the sustainability of their use and renewability is fundamental. Groundwater recharge processes (defined as the downward flow of water reaching the water table) govern the replenishment of groundwater systems (also called aquifers). Recharge is a critical part of the overall water budget and is one of the most difficult components to quantify. The Limpopo River Basin (LRB) counts on a few very high-yielding dolomite aquifers, as well as large tracts of smaller and less productive crystalline aquifers, each having different recharge processes and groundwater management issues associated with them. While emerging research and incipient field evidence in the LRB suggest that recharge in these semi-arid environments is episodic and driven by climate extremes (van Wyk et al., 2011), simplifying assumptions around annual and steady replenishment persist. This misinterpretation implies a false perception of continuous replenishment and resource security, while in reality the renewal is sporadic and dependent on fewer and interspersed (often decadal) extreme rainfall events. Another conventional perception or approximation is that recharge occurs as a uniform and diffuse or omnipresent process in the landscape, while it is often governed by preferential pathways at different scales, e.g. through fractures in the subsurface, through intermittently flooded and inundated areas and flow channels, like rivers, or at mountain fronts. Finally, understanding groundwater renewability and upper limits for exploitation in an environmental/ecosystem context is in a relatively early stage. This project builds on existing research to (1) better determine processes, quantities, and locations of recharge in the LRB, and (2) use this information in groundwater development, use, and management in selected sites.",

    "description": "This study proposes a value-chain approach to answer important research questions for sustainable agriculture, food and water security, and social-hydrological resilience. How can we secure scarce water resources along rural small-scale crop farming value chains at a river basin scale? How can we promote water security that supports small-scale agricultural productivity? How can we improve access to appropriate quantity and quality of water to ensure food security and social-hydrological resilience? \n \n To answer these questions, the PI and her team will take three distinct approaches. The initial phase of the project will involve a detailed literature review on agricultural water use, security, productivity and footprinting. The review will seek to document the potential benefits of understanding water utilisation by rural small-scale crops in South Africa and the broader region. This initial phase of the proposed research will also contribute to the identification of suitable sites and suitable crops to be evaluated. In the second phase, the researchers will apply the value-chain analysis framework to assess water use in the production, post-harvest handling, and consumption of selected crops in the Limpopo and Zambezi River Basins. Value-chain mapping will also be used to identify and characterize actors and their linkages, from the producer to the final consumer. Comparison of variations of water use values for selected smallholder crops will be carried out, complemented by data from the value-chain mapping exercise. The team will use participatory rural appraisals to generate sufficient data for the value chain mapping. The third phase of the study will involve the process of estimating the water footprint for selected crops within the Limpopo and Zambezi River Basins. The focus will be on the production stage, that is, the cultivation of the agricultural crops from planting to harvesting, during the 1990-2017 period. The team will compare the water footprint for crops grown in both the Limpopo Basin and the Zambezi Basin to produce regional data sets that can inform policy. The proposed water footprinting exercise will provide information that is useful for post-harvest applications, as well.",

    "description": "Studies of the utility of drought and flood hazard indices indicate that a thorough depiction of hazard risks requires combined analysis of the co-variation of multiple meteorological and terrestrial variables such as rainfall, runoff, and soil moisture conditions. Current hazard estimations do not objectively combine separate indicators into an overall assessment of hazard risks and the impacts of climate variability. In countries such as Sri Lanka and Maldives there are severe constraints on real-time data availability. Such shortfalls can impair the reliability of and access to real-time hazard assessments if based entirely on one source of data. Freely available data from satellite estimates for soil moisture and prediction products from NASA and NOAA can be very useful, and field testing their accuracy in tropical locations should also help in validating them. This project will involve expanding, testing, and implementing a hazard analysis framework for combining multiple terrestrial indicators to estimate the probability of drought and floods. This work builds on studies of hazards, climate and land surface modeling, and disasters previously completed by the research team, some of it in cooperation with the U.S. Government-supported partner. \n \n Sri Lanka is densely populated with high spatial variability in climate and high vulnerability to disasters. Recent droughts have led to drops in economic growth and losses in livelihoods. Floods are a leading causes of loss in life from natural disasters of the population of 21 million. In 2014, a severe drought emergency up to September was followed by flood emergency from till December. The Maldives is a country made up of almost 1,200 small islands, and their isolated location, size, and storage limitations leave the population of 350,000 vulnerable to drought risk. In recent years, there has been more frequent drought and increasing groundwater contamination. Although, climate variability and its impacts on hazards are of critical importance in both countries, the scientific understanding is not equal to the risk, and available information is not adequately accessed. Major policy decisions and large projects related to hazard are being undertaken without a robust basis in current science. The development-related objective of this project is to build integrated assessment, monitoring, and prediction capabilities for natural hazards that will be useful for decision makers. In Sri Lanka, the team will instrument two sites for measuring soil moisture, river levels, and ground water and provide water scarcity assessments to the Water Management Services Panel, building on a weekly climate advisory already provided to this panel. In the Maldives, the focus will be on drought and groundwater assessments, which will be conducted in liason with the Meteorological and Water Supply Services, hydrologists, and instrumentation specialists. The project team will undertake field measurements of meteorology, soil moisture, and the groundwater lens in two regions.",

Current treatment is similar to treatment of lung TB, although penetration of some antibiotics into the brain is poor and the immune-pathology of TB meningitis is very different from pulmonary TB. Current treatment regimens are not based on clinical trials. Rifampicin is a key drug for TBM, but its penetration into the brain is limited, suggesting that a higher dose may be more effective.

    "description": "About 60% of the water that potentially flows to the lower Aral Basin originates in the high mountains of Tajikistan. Existing dams like Nurek and those under construction like Rogun control and regulate the annual flow regime. The demand for winter hydropower generation in the upstream countries where the dams are located conflicts with the summer demand for irrigation in the downstream parts of the basin. In addition, the actually available water resources are less than those stated in official negotiations due to siltation and reduced storage capacities, and summer runoff generation has been affected by glacier shrinkage, a process that not yet been taken into account. To ensure sustainable water management, we need reliable information on present and future water resources and their evolution in relation to human activities, global change, and climate evolution affecting the hydrological and melting regime of the Amu Darya’s main tributaries. It is important to know not only what the supply will be but also what the real needs are, such as actual irrigation requirements. For good planning, verifiable data are essential instead of perceived demand based on unreliable historical data, previous designs, and erroneous information. This project is designed to provide a clear picture of available water resources and to predict the changes likely to occur into the future. This will provide the riparian states with the essential information for effective water resource planning at the basin level.

    "description": "This study will investigate quantitative and qualitative mercury availability in the environment surrounding artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) locations in Tanzania, where mercury contamination is of concern with regard to the health of community members and others who consume food products originating from the area. Although mercury contamination can be lessened by appropriate controls and proper handling methods, such measures are not routinely applied in Tanzania, where mercury has been documented in different environments and studies. Mercury can be transported away from emission sources by riverine systems to large water bodies like Lake Victoria. The resulting fish contamination can be significant, which is a particularly serious issue as fish are the major protein source in the region and the whole country. In Tanzania, very little data is available on levels of methylmercury in biota and sediments and on the contribution that ASGM activities make to these levels. Further, there is little information on the relative importance of riverine and atmospheric processes in transporting mercury from sources to ecosystems. All these aspects must be taken into accoutn in order to understand the magnitude of mercury impacts on the environment and on human beings. This project will develop data on levels of mercury downwind and downstream from ASGM activities in water, suspended particulate matter, sediments, and fish and improve understanding of spatiotemporal variations of mercury levels. Inclusion of methylmercury in the analysis represents a significant extension of the PI’s earlier work. \n \n Tanzania is now in the process of ratifying the Minamata Convention, a key goal of which is to raise awareness of health concerns, especially in developing countries, resulting from mercury exposure of vulnerable populations, especially women and children. Mercury emissions from ASGM activities in Tanzania cause food chain contamination that poses direct threats to vulnerable populations under the Convention. In preparation for ratifying the Minamata Convention, Tanzania needs to establish country-based information on the sources and extent of mercury contamination. The data and analysis generated in this project will help inform policies for protection of water quality and foodstuff safety, as well as provide scientific information to aid the formulation of the legal framework on mercury that will be needed for government regulations.",

    "description": "Home to tremendous biodiversity, the Srepok, Sesan and Sekong (3S) rivers of the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) straddle Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam and provide food security for millions of people. An annual flood pulse provides nutrients to surrounding farmlands and sustains rice production, influences primary and secondary fish production, and cues the reproductive migration of fish species, the dominant animal protein for more than 60 million people in the LMB (Hori, 2000; Stone et al., 2011). The 3S tributaries are dammed to produce hydropower, with rapid economic growth driving the region to construct more dams. Climate change is likely to significantly alter river flow in the region, which will lower energy production from dams and threaten the timing, frequency, and magnitude of the flood pulse. Therefore, we must now assess climate change impacts on river flows, dam development and operations, and fish habitat in the LMB to reduce future risks to energy production and food security. To develop optimum hydropower projects under climate change scenarios in the 3S basin, the PI and his colleagues in Thailand and Cambodia will answer the following questions: \n \n 1. What are the scenarios of hydropower production and fish harvest under current climatic conditions? \n 2. How will the climate of the 3S river basin change in the near (2030s), mid (2050s), and distant (2080s) future?\n 3. What impact will future climate have on river flow, dam operations, hydropower, and fish habitats? \n \n This project should contribute to developing the capacity of individuals and institutions to optimize hydropower production and the fish harvest. The researchers involved will generate very high-resolution climate data by downscaling multiple regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparision Project 5 (CMIP5). Using this integrated modeling tool, the team will assess the impacts of climate change and hydropower operations on river flows, flood pulse, and energy and fish production, plus build an understanding of the key trade-offs. They will use a multiple optimization method (control theory) to develop decision scenarios to optimize hydropower production and fish harvest under future climate scenarios, leading to recommendations for government policymakers nationally and regionally. A multi-modeling approach, integrated with education and capacity building, can reduce decision making uncertainties under climate change scenarios and risks associated with energy and food security in the LMB region.",

Such an integrated eco-technology should facilitate the production of biogas from the produced micro-algal biomass for electrical and heat energy generation, as well as biodiesel production, the extraction of high-added-value molecules for cosmetics and nutraceutical applications, nutrient recovery in the form of sludge and biochar for soil amendments, and treated OMW for ferti-irrigation use. This eco-technology will also improve the quality of life for local residents living near the OMW discharge area by reducing the environmental footprint of the existing evaporation ponds, in particular reducing populations of mosquitoes and noxious odors from the ponds.\n \n Beyond the technological aspects, the project will also involve the collection and assessment of data to support decision-makers for the promotion of sound strategies and best practices for social, economic, and legislative measures at the regional and national levels regarding agricultural waste management. It is expected to generate business opportunities and create jobs in small and innovative companies for commercializing the process outcomes. The research team will also strive to enhance the impacts of the project by organizing roundtables and training workshops for farmers to help them better exploit the anticipated research results with regard to ferti-irrigation and soil fertilization.",

    "description": "The project will develop a high-resolution modeling system for marine waters along the Tunisia coasts (Central Mediterranean) using NOAA atmospheric and oceanic forcing fields. The modeling system will provide maps of the marine areas where ocean energy can be potentially used for power generation. The project will provide information on the circulation of water masses along and off the Tunisian coasts. In particular, information on circulation veins (the Atlantic vein, modulated by atmospheric conditions) will be provided for the first time at a high resolution. Additionally, water temperature and salinity maps will be developed, which are important for several of Tunisia’s economic sectors. The model results will be validated by direct observations in the sea using NOAA analytical tools. Once set up, the modeling system will constitute an important modeling platform for marine studies at INSTM.\n \n Results from the project will provide information that may help in the creation of renewable energy alternatives by the Tunisia Electricity Company. Such information combined with that from tides and waves will be of interest for several economic applications, such as implementation of off-shore aquaculture cages, a rapidly increasing activity in Tunisia, and impact studies of coastal infrastructure implementation (e.g., the impact of highly concentrated salt brine from desalinization plants). The INSTM research team will gain knowledge on the use of high-resolution ocean models forced by atmospheric fields (weather and climate) and ocean models/outputs provided by NOAA. The project is a valuable opportunity for building the capacity at INSTM. PhDs, Master's students, and engineers at INSTM will be involved in the project and will ensure the sustainability of such a combined modeling-observation approach at the institution.",

    "description": "Water availability and accessibility are concerns that water managers strive to address in the face of climate change, population growth, and food insecurity. Water resources are strained during extreme hydrologic events, and as climate variability and extremes increase (Trenberth, 2012), the uncertainty of freshwater availability poses a threat for emerging economies like Uganda. Anecdotal reports from Uganda indicate that shrinking rivers and diminishing groundwater resources (Lwanga, 2015) have become commonplace, both of which indicate declines in groundwater storage. Water harvesting has the potential to mitigate climate impacts in the short-term (Kahinda et al., 2010); however, potential hydrologic alterations from such small-scale water captures and storage are unknown. \n \n This study seeks to assess the viability of increasing water harvesting efforts in Uganda by examining associated hydrological impacts that result from the capture and storage of water. This study will apply an integrated modelling framework to exploit multivariate remote sensing data from NASA satellite missions combined with ground-based hydrologic observations to examine the spatial and temporal impacts of water harvesting. This project is a pilot study for model development and hypothesis testing. It thus provides a first step towards generation of a decision-support system for evaluating water use and management scenarios in the face of climate change and development. The research team will also address broader national development goals, including aiding decision making for development efforts towards irrigation-based agricultural production, as well as livelihoods. Results of the study should help to inform ongoing government efforts (for example, the Karamoja Action Plan for Food Security) aimed at transitioning the Karamoja dry-land communities from pastoralism to crop farming.",

    "description": "Tuberculosis (TB) and tobacco use are two formidable public health concerns and independently pose considerable threats to global health. In 2013, there were about 9 million new TB cases and 1.5 million TB-related deaths globally. In 2011, nearly 6 million people died from tobacco use globally. Tobacco use is responsible for 16% and 7% of annual deaths among men and women, respectively (WHO 2015). Beyond health implications, TB and tobacco use impose severe economic and social costs on families and communities, particularly for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Globally, more than 20% of TB cases are attributable to smoking, hence the critical need to reduce TB prevalence through smoking cessation. There is sparse information on how to incorporate tobacco control into TB programs in LMIC, particularly using mHealth solutions, even though the WHO Global TB program calls for an integrated approach toward TB-tobacco prevention and treatment. Given that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) now dominate healthcare in developed countries and most LMICs and that most LMICs are now facing a double burden of disease, there is an opportunity to broaden the mHealth agenda in developing countries to also look at NCDs. Previous studies into the use of mHealth technology for smoking cessation indicate significant potential in successful behavior change. \n \n This project will provide policy and program recommendations to the TB program and the tobacco control programs in Uganda. The impact indicator is the improved health status of TB patients, which will be measured using the tobacco quit rates and TB treatment protocol adherence. Integrating tobacco cessation health education in treatment programs for TB patients improves the knowledge of TB patients, hence increasing their health-seeking behavior, an issue relevant to Uganda’s development objectives. It also improves organization and management of TB programs by giving TB patients access to tobacco cessation education and support when seeking TB treatment. This integration will include training of health workers and should result in improving the quality of health services. At the community level, the impact will be in giving patients access to the services even when they are not at the facility using the mHealth aspect. The project will recommend the use of the mCessation approach using SMS as a solution to providing information, following up with patients, and supporting them to quit tobacco use. The community impact indicators will be the proportion of messages responded to and the percentage of TB patients who changed behavior.",

    "description": "Cassava is a very important food security crop in Uganda and in the region and is a major crop grown by small-scale farmers who depend on it for their livelihood. The overarching goal of this project is to improve livelihoods of these small-holder farmers through provision of better tools that offer them actionable information about the health of their crops. This goal can further be broken down to two aims. The first centers around crowd sourcing of crop disease surveillance data from farmers. A total of 200 farmers will be provided with smart phones and, using several incentive schemes, will be encouraged to collect data about the state of health of their farms and gardens. The data will include both images and their geo-coordinates. The principal investigator’s hypothesis is that a great deal of data can be collected from all over the country cheaply and that this will be an empowering activity for the farmers. The second aim is to provide farmers with a system that can be used to provide real-time diagnosis of their crops. The mobile phones will be equipped with software that can calculate the state of health of a cassava crop by analyzing an image of its leaves. A farmer is therefore able to make the necessary early interventions in his garden.\n \n This project draws on a prototype crowd sourcing system that the PI and his team have been testing for more than a year. They distributed phones to 29 people involved in agriculture in the different regions of Uganda and created a mobile phone application that they modified to allow the participants to take pictures of crops and upload them in real time. Data collected consists of an image of the cassava crop, the GPS coordinates, and a statement of whether the image taken is representative of disease, pests, or an anomaly. Using this current system the researchers collected more than 4,800 images from different places in Uganda (http://adsurv.mcrops.org/). Their PEER award will allow them to expand the network to 200 participants in order to generate evidence for a large-scale deployment of a digital system for crop disease surveillance data collection. In particular, they are interested in understanding how accurate the inferences from such data can be, how useful an on-field diagnosis application can be for smallholder farmers, and what incentive mechanisms work.",

    "name": "PEER - Mitigating the competition for water in Amudarya River basin, Central Asia by improving water use efficiency\n PEER4-097",
    "description": "The growing population of Central Asia has resulted in an increased demand for water for food and hydropower generation. Most of the renewable water resources are transboundary, with the main rivers flowing through several states. The hydropower generation potential is upstream, where the key reservoirs regulate the river flow, while the irrigated land, requiring 80% of the river flow, is located downstream. With water in short supply the competition for water between hydropower upstream and agriculture downstream results in reduced water use efficiency and, overall, in reduced basin-wide water productivity. Prior to recent changes, the operational regime of the upstream reservoir gave priority to upstream hydropower needs in the Syrdarya River basin, while the downstream states faced significant losses for irrigation. Developing the upstream hydropower potential may cause further reduction of water availability downstream during the crop-growing season. Under the current operating practices of the upstream reservoir, which prioritizes the needs of agriculture in the Amudarya River basin, the upstream states face significant energy shortages. The issue is very politically sensitive, when a win for one side means a loss for the other. Under these conditions securing water for agriculture through increased water use efficiency is critical for Central Asian states (Karimov et. Al, 2012). \n \n The solution for the problem is highly complicated because of significant shortage of water to supply the needs of both – water for food and water for energy in Aral Sea basin. This project takes a two-step approach. The first is determining water and energy “gains” through increasing current water use efficiency and reducing current energy use intensity in different sectors (such as agriculture, domestic water and energy supply, industry, and power generation), which can be considered while supplying the water and energy needs of upstream and downstream users. The second is considering the above-indicated gains of demand management while analyzing benefits of cooperation. This study will focus on estimating gains through improving water and energy use in agriculture, only. Close cooperation will be established between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) Central Asia, the United States Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS), and local partners, including specialists from the Research and Design Institute UzGIP under the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Management, Uzbekistan. The project will increase the knowledge base of water management institutes in both river basins by proposing improved irrigation technologies and management alternatives that will result in improved water use efficiency and productivity and that have high potential for adoption. Policy makers will also gain expertise by learning about potential solutions that can mitigate growing competition for water between the food and energy sectors.",

    "description": "Research planned in this proposal looks into science-practice interactions on environmental issues. Water quality change dynamics are the focus of many research studies; however, systematic understanding of the linkages between emerging climate change challenges and water quality is very rarely studied. In the current context, most of the climate-related studies in Central Asia are focused on water quantity impacts and their implications for transboundary water allocation in the region. However, the studies have neither investigated nor documented the water quality aspects of climate change impacts, especially for Central Asia's two biggest river systems (Amu Darya and Syr Darya). The main objective of this PEER project is to assess the impacts of climate change on surface water quality of the Amu Darya River and develop a \"climate change - water quality\" model that will provide much needed information to decision makers for elaboration of possible adaptation actions. The research is aimed at putting water quality back on the agenda by taking a holistic view on climate change that will affect every aspect of water resources, including quantity, quality, inter-state/ transboundary water management, and, in the longer run, food security and sustainable development in the region as a whole.\n \n Even though it is within the mandate of transboundary organizations, such as the river basin management organization BVO Amudarya, the issue of water quality in the basin is currently neglected due to the absence of relevant information and data in the region, as well as the lack of the capacity to investigate the issue. Therefore, the project will also transfer acquired knowledge and data to the region and enhance research capacities in Central Asia based on the tools, approaches, and methods to be applies. The study will be scientifically complemented by counterpart researchers from West Virginia University, who will take part in joint discussions of the research design integrating existing models into a new Climate Change Impact on Water Quality in the Amu Darya Basin (CCIWQAB) model. In addition to helping with the calibration, validation, simulation stages, and analysis of results, the WVU specialists will organize training workshops for CAREC researchers on methodological aspects and relevant numerical and analytical tools for water quality predictions.\n \n Given the project’s goal of contributing to regional water cooperation by improving regional knowledge, data output, information sharing, and capacities, the research effort will be carried out by scientists from CAREC and counterparts from Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, including the basin organization BVO Amudarya. A special focus will be to build the capacity of BVO Amudarya in terms of water quality maintenance. The project should also help to raise awareness of states and key stakeholders on climate change impacts on water quality. A series of policy dialogues among policy makers that share water in the Amu Darya Basin will be organized to share results of the study.",

Improving water use efficiency by utilizing data generated from a previously initiated PEER project (i.e., a geodatabase prepared for lift-irrigated areas) to identify current water use efficiencies in selected sites according to a set of indicators and subsequently to develop and recommend potential improvements\n 4. Assessing the current environmental and socioeconomic impact of irrigation and identifying possible interventions to improve rural livelihoods (e.g., restoring ecosystems and their services) \n 5. Preparing policy documents evaluating different methods based on a set of criteria for improving water use efficiency and reducing energy use, CO2 emissions, and return flow in lift-irrigated areas\n \n The partnerships and collaboration envisioned within the scope of this project are carefully selected to be appropriate for the complexity of the activities and enhance transboundary institutional collaboration. In essence, the project can be viewed as two projects under a shared goal, as the two case studies are (1) located in different countries and in different river basins, (2) influenced by different sociopolitical circumstances, and (3) affected by different legal and administrative structures. The three regional partners involved under the auspices of the lead institution, IWMI, (1) the Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Melioration under the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources of Uzbekistan; (2) the Sogd Water Authority in Tajikistan; and (3) the Institute of Sanitary, Hygiene, and Professional Disease, Department of the Hygiene of Water and Soil, under the Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan. These transboundary partnerships build on and strengthen existing coordination established under two previous projects in PEER Cycles 4 and 5 between the transboundary government agencies. The project’s US partners are Dr. James Ayars from the US Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Services and Dr. Catherine A. Berry from the University of Nevada, Reno.",

    "description": "This project is based on the hypothesis that marginal (low quality) water sources and marginal lands can be used for irrigation and production of non-conventional crops (NCC) as food for human consumption and/or forage for livestock while simultaneously conserving water quality and protecting economic benefits for households. Through practical and analytical experiments on selected sites within the Amu Darya River Basin, Dr. Toderich and her team will investigate economic and environmental impacts of using NCC on salt-affected lands and mineralized waters. These experiments, coupled with their previous results and experience studying various halophytes (salt-tolerant plants), will be integrated into biophysical models that will allow for broader-scale assessment of NCC capacity to improve marginal lands across the region. These experimental and modeled assessments of NCC support local decision-makers in efficient use of local resources, thus helping to improve agricultural productivity and food security of rural households in drylands, as well as helping rural populations adapt to climate change. The project will analyze current and future projected scenarios of water availability in the region, at the same time investigating possible options for reducing water and land stress. The researchers will assess current and future water policy in the region under impact of the utilization of NCC and use of mineralized waters in creating forage for cattle breeding. Such analysis can show the potential of marginal resources as an important link in creating a full cycle of environmentally friendly and economically beneficial scenarios of community development in arid and semi-arid regions. \n \n The project applies an integrated approach to transboundary watershed management of the Amu Darya River Basin to address water resources availability, water quality deterioration, land degradation and ecosystem loss across three river sub-basins located upstream, midstream, and downstream along the Amu Darya River. In each sub-basin, a set of environmentally-friendly interventions will be tested for their ability to better manage water flow, salt accumulation, water quality, and NCC, and thus guide adoption of alternative ways of agriculture to ensure sustainable land and water use and ecosystem stabilization. Collaboration among researchers from different institutions and water and land users will facilitate extension of the implications of project results with other regions with similar environments. Through a participatory approach, water users, women farmers, and low-income families will be trained to cultivate and use NCC. The project will also create a freely-available analytical database to inform stakeholders about best practices and low-cost agriculture production and irrigation technologies. The project will also strengthen regional partnership networks and knowledge exchanges among experts in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.",

    "name": "PEER -Implications of climate change, land use and adaptation interventions on water resources and agricultural production in Transboundary Amu Darya river basin\n PEER5-523",
    "description": "The transboundary Amu Darya and Syr Darya river basins draining to the Aral Sea in Central Asia witnessed widespread land use and land cover changes (LULCC) during 20th century as a result of political reforms of agrarian systems to enhance economic opportunities for a growing population. These developments produced drastic change in the hydrological regime of these two river basins, causing widespread ecosystem degradation (Shira Babow, 2012). The need to sustain competing water uses at the local, national, and transboundary levels, including on upstream hydropower generation and downstream irrigation requirements under climate change, make the current situation more contentious (FCG, 2012). Realizing the need to balance and sustain competing water uses, national governments in Central Asia and international agencies are supporting numerous mitigation and adaptation interventions to improve overall water use efficiency in basins draining to the Aral Sea. However, successful interventions must be based on comprehensive understanding of the interactions in agro-hydrological systems at multiple scales covering sufficiently long time periods, and they must account for forecasted climate change impacts. So far, there are no openly available models and tools with detailed descriptions of such spatio-temporal changes and interactions of agro-hydrologic systems in the Amu Darya River Basin that can used to inform evidence-based decision-making by national research organizations and donor agencies. Even if studies on these topics were undertaken in the past, their availability is restricted. This project proposes to promote a greater understanding of past land use and land cover changes in the Amu Darya Basin, expected changes in the future, and basin-scale climate change impacts and adaptation interventions for water resources, using openly available long-term Earth observation datasets and a semi-distributed hydrological model (SWAT) detailing the agro-hydro-climatological system. The tools and models will act as vital management instruments for national water agencies and multilateral activities to assist in planning future interventions at basin or local scales.\n \n This proposal aligns with USAID’s Regional Development Cooperation Strategy (RCDS) for the Central Asian region (2015-2019), specifically with regard to Development Objective DO 2: “Enhanced regional cooperation on shared energy and water resources.” This project will assess water resource availability in the Amu Darya Basin, looking at past, present, and future land-use and climate-change scenarios at the basin scale, covering all the riparian countries. The project will provide comprehensive, unbiased water resources scenarios for the basin at multiple scales for the riparian countries, thus serving as a conduit to help resolve prevalent sources of conflicts and promote integrated water resources management and greater regional cooperation on water issues. One of the main outcomes of this project is to provide local organizations in riparian countries involved in watershed management and planning with openly available, readily updatable model tools and map projections that can be used for designing and implementing intervention measures.\n \n Within the scope of this project, close partnership and collaboration will be established between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Karakalpak branch office of the Scientific Research Institute of Irrigation and Water Problems–Uzbekistan, Balkh University (Afghanistan), and the Institute of Water Problems, Hydropower Engineering, and Ecology of the Academy of Sciences–Republic of Tajikistan. In association with the U.S. partner based at NASA, IWMI will actively pursue knowledge transfer avenues on use of the expected project outputs, such as land-use change projections, water availability under climate-change scenarios, and use of the SWAT model by a wide stakeholder network covering national, regional, and international organizations. Best practices and lesson learned from a similar project in the Lower Mekong Basin undertaken by the U.S. partner will be incorporated into this Amu Darya Basin project. This project provides a structured opportunity to boost the application and knowledge transfer of freely available remote sensing data sets and hydrological models to the riparian countries to design, test, and share improved water management methods. These state-of-the-art tools, models, and insights will be used to bridge the existing technical knowledg",

    "name": "PEER - An assessment of smoking and access to care as risk factors for gender-differences in TB rates – a substudy of the Vietnam NTP TB prevalence survey 2016-2018 (PEER 5-666)",
    "description": "The global burden of 9.4 million annual cases of tuberculosis (TB) overwhelmingly falls on low-income countries, with 80% of cases occurring in just 22 high-burden countries. Between 1998 and 2008, the average male to female ratio of new smear-positive cases for high-burden countries was 1.85 (range = 0.47–3.16). The male to female ratio of notified new sputum smear positive TB cases for various World Health Organization’s (WHO) regions range from 1.4:1 in Africa; 1.5:1 in Americas, and 2: 1 in South-East Asia to 2.2: 1 in Europe. Although every country is unique, there are now reports that show that the gender differences observed in case notifications are often mirrored by gender differences in prevalent TB cases. These studies indicate that there are genuine gender differences in the biology and epidemiology of TB. Vietnam falls among the countries having the highest TB burden in the world, with an estimated incidence of around 140 new TB cases per 100,000 population annually. Additionally, the Annual Report of the Vietnam National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) notes that the program detects nearly three times more male than female TB patients in the notification rate of pulmonary TB.\n \n Repeat TB prevalence surveys provide useful data on trends in the burden of disease caused by TB. Repeat surveys conducted with an interval of five years or more allow for direct measurement of whether the burden of TB is stable, increasing, or decreasing. They can also be used to assess the impact of efforts to control TB. In addition to the prevalence survey, the embedded sub-study assessing smoking and access to care as risk factors for TB plays an important part in determining the role smoking might play in creating gender differences among TB cases. The importance of a gender perspective on current policies regarding disease prevention and treatment is slowly being recognized, but so far this aspect on smoking and gender differences has not been fully acknowledged within programs to combat TB. The collaboration between the Vietnam NTP and the Vietnam Steering Committee on Smoking and Health is reportedly very limited. While the DOTS (directly observed treatment, short-course) strategy has become the standard treatment protocol for TB control in most countries, most current TB control strategies fail to account for the increased risk of recurrence due to smoking. To reduce the risk of recurrence, it is thus imperative to incorporate effective smoking cessation measures into TB control program, as recommended by the WHO Stop TB Strategy. A better understanding of the incidence of, and factors associated with, TB infection and recurrence may help in identifying the most vulnerable populations and developing effective control measures that lower the rate of TB infection. The results from this study should help to inform policy and program managers and support advice to identify gender-sensitive recommendations on smoking policy and prevention to improve current TB control policies and programs to reach the Vietnam’s ambitious targets in 2020 and 2030.",

    "description": "The overall goal of this project is to transfer and build locally-developed applications of advanced technologies, including GRACE satellite gravimetry, satellite altimetry, and hydrologic and hydraulic models to Vietnamese institutions and agencies that manage groundwater resources in the Red River Delta (RRD) of Vietnam. In this project, the Institute of Environmental Science and Engineering (IESE) and the National Center for Water Resources Planning and Investigation (NAWAPI) will partner with the NASA-supported project “NASA WATER—Towards Operational Water Resources Management in South Asia Exploiting Satellite Geodetic and Remote Sensing Technologies (2014-2018),” which is led by Dr. Faisal Hossain at the University of Washington (UW). This three-year project is the first ever study adopting the promisingly integrated approach of geodetic, satellite remote sensing, and physical modeling tools for groundwater assessment in Vietnam. It is expected to provide a totally new spatial and temporal dataset for groundwater monitoring in the RRD, where groundwater is being over-exploited for domestic use and intensively irrigated agriculture activities. These efforts will support NAWAPI and relevant governmental agencies in their decision making activities for sustainable management of groundwater in this region and Vietnam. To achieve its goal, this project will provide technical training for IESE and NAWAPI staff members on independently managing and interpreting data from geodetic and satellite remote sensing, hydrologic, and hydraulic modeling tools for extracting regional and local-scale changes in groundwater storage anomalies for the RRD. This would then facilitate making projections for water resources planning at 30- to 180-day timescales for the RRD. \n \n This project supports USAID’s aims to strengthen the capacities of local stakeholders to address climate change impacts and build people’s resilience to long-term climate change. The innovative approach adopted in this project could be adapted and applied to similar research in other regions in Vietnam by local stakeholders without long-term dependency on the U.S. partners involved. Importantly, by participating in this project, research capacity and knowledge of project PI and other members with respect to application of geodetic, satellite remote sensing, and physical modeling tools for groundwater management would be significantly enhanced. In addition, the research infrastructure (remote sensing and GIS lab facilities, software, etc.) with the integrated system (geodetic, satellite remote sensing, and physical modeling tools) installed in this infrastructure would be built up at IESE. Along with the new knowledge and skills to be gained by Institute staff, these assets should contribute positively to other future research to be carried out at IESE.",

    "description": "Vietnam is one of the worst dioxin-contaminated areas in the world as a result of extensive use of the herbicide “Agent Orange” (AO) during the war (1961–1971). The worst contaminated sites in Vietnam are located at airbases where large quantities of AO were stored/handled. These areas still pose serious environmental and health risks. To date, no low-cost, effective phytoremediation technology has been developed to stabilize, mitigate, and remediate soils with low to moderate levels of dioxin contamination over large areas. Initial studies with vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides L.) indicate that it is a very promising candidate for providing such an alternative. This PEER project will (1) assess the use of vetiver grass for the phytoremediation and phytostabilization of dioxin-contaminated soils on a field scale at Bien Hoa Airbase and (2) deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of dioxin uptake and degradation pathways of Vetiver grass. The Monto genotype–a known, noninvasive type of vetiver grass (hereafter “Monto”)—will be used in the two proposed experiments. The indoor experiment will help address and clarify the remaining issues in phytostabilization and phytoremediation from a previous project completed by the PI. The field experiment will help reevaluate the results from the indoor experiment, and the potential use of vetiver in phytostabilization of dioxin-contaminated sites will be assessed. \n \n The project will benefit about 135,000 people in the vicinity of the airbase, particularly the personnel of the No. 935 Air Regiment, by helping to reduce the potential health risks associated with dioxin. Furthermore, the results of the proposed project should significantly contribute to advances in phytoremediation technology that can be applied elsewhere in Vietnam and worldwide. The practical measures to be developed and tesetd will also help local, regional, and national policy makers and NGO-sponsored programs develop and evaluate short- and long-term mitigation and remediation alternatives and ultimately implement remedial actions effectively. Through workshops with local people, potential adverse health-related, environmental, and social issues will be addressed to help raise community awareness of dioxin-related issues and solutions. By providing funding support for PhD and MSc students, the project is also expected to foster a new generation of environmentalists interested in phytoremediation technology.",

    "description": "Land and forest are being overexploited in the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMB) due to the pressure of rapid economic development and high population growth. These factors may impact the functions and services of land ecosystems, including biomass productivity. Because human livelihoods in the LMB still rely strongly on agricultural production, land degradation will be a significant issue for development strategies. In tropical regions, poverty and land degradation are often part of a downward spiral: poverty and economic marginalization lead to overexploitation of land resources, resulting in land degradation, which then leads to more serious poverty. To combat land degradation, policy makers often need information to identify areas of most intense degradation in order to plan strategic interventions. The specific objectives of this project include \n Producing a map of geospatial biomass productivity decline for the LMB (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand), using long-term biomass productivity trends as a proxy for land degradation;\n Differentiating human-induced land degradation from climate-driven signals by examining the temporal correlation between long-term biomass productivity trends and climate data; and\n Identifying potential underlying processes (population density, soil/terrain conditions, and land-cover types) that affect land degradation.\n The map of land degradation hotspots to be created may help researchers and policy makers identify locations in the LMB where more detailed actions may be required. Through project activities, team members will improve their research capacity and knowledge regarding applications of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) for assessing natural resources. Land degradation is also linked with biodiversity loss and climate change at the global and local levels, so this project should also help to serve as a reference database for further studies on climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation of emissions from land use in the agriculture, land cover, and forestry sectors. The project team will be supported by U.S. partner Dr. Bolten, who has experience in remote sensing research in the same region.

    "description": "Development of sustainable forest management and conservation strategies requires an understanding of how the composition and structure of tropical forests change in response to different disturbance regimes and how this affects both species distributions and people living in and near these forests. Most forests in Vietnam are affected by land cover change (LCC) resulting from human activities. To map and quantify the patterns of LCC, Dr. Huong and his team will analyze Landsat satellite images, GIS data, and field inventory data to classify forests by type and disturbance status. They will use these maps to stratify their field sampling and assess plant biodiversity among forest types and their changes following different levels of human disturbances (i.e., minor, moderate, and heavy impact). Furthermore, they will compare tree composition and structure along different ecological gradients, such as topography. By combining remote sensing, field data, and statistical processing, they expect to advance current methods to measure disturbance and biodiversity in the Central Highlands, which are largely based on field inventories. However, remotely sensed data is likely insufficient to map rare and endangered species, and hence areas of high conservation value. Therefore, the researchers will integrate spatial data with the experience of forestry workers and the indigenous knowledge of local people in the second phase of the project. Dr. Huong and his colleagues will collaborate closely with Dr. Radeloff, who will provide expert advice on forest sampling, analysis of vegetation diversity, and the use of remote sensing in ecology and biodiversity.\n \n The project will involve all relevant stakeholders, including local authorities, forestry officers from various levels, and local people who depend on the forest. The project is designed so as to enhance conservation awareness among local people and improve skills and knowledge among forestry workers and officials responsible for conservation. The results will be transferred to relevant departments and reported to the Provincial People’s Committee (PPC) of Daklak in the form of recommendations for forestry strategies. This will be of crucial importance for the PPC in order to implement proper forestry policies, conservation strategies, and forest management for the province in the context of climate change. Furthermore results from the project will contribute in several ways to the development of techniques, methodology, and training in forest biodiversity inventory and monitoring, which is still very limited in the Central Highlands, including Daklak Province. Combining remote sensing, terrestrial data, and social surveys will also provide insights into how forest dynamics in the Central Highlands have changed in recent decades. These inferences will contribute to development of a strategy for forest management that can incorporate payments for ecosystem services, REDD, and biodiversity conservation in the Central Highlands.",

    "description": "This project is aimed at understanding coral reef resilience capacity in comparative areas in southern Vietnam under changing stresses (increased temperature and human activities) and developing guidelines for biodiversity conservation and resources management. To achieve these goals, the researchers will assess coral bleaching in 2016 in three representative reef areas (Nha Trang Ninh Thuan coastal waters as an example of an upwelling area, Con Dao islands in the western South China Sea, and Phu Quoc islands in the coastal Gulf of Thailand). They will also conduct studies on biological and physical features associated with coral reef resilience at the site level of each area in order to develop recommendations on possible changes in zoning and adaptive management of marine protected areas (MPAs). Studies will also be carried out on settlement and recruitment of corals and inter-population connectivity of target reef organisms among the three areas. Near the end of the project, the team will develop guidelines for the conservation of marine biodiversity in southern Vietnam to promote resilience to sea temperature changes and human activities. The U.S. partner and his colleagues will provide their experience and data, especially in nowcasting and forecasting of sea temperatures in relation to coral bleaching and other phenomena. NOAA methodology on coral reef resilience will be critical in order to ensure that data on the project are aligned with international standards.\n \n The project will facilitate improvement of zoning and adaptive management of several protected areas, including Nha Trang Bay MPA, Nui Chua and Con Dao National Parks, and Phu Quoc MPA.
